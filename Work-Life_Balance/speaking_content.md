### **Band 6 Model Answers & Useful Language**

#### **Part 2 Model Answer**

"Okay, so I’d like to talk about a period last year, around November, when I was extremely busy. It was during the final semester of my university course, and I had several major deadlines all at the same time.

I had to complete a 5,000-word dissertation, which was the biggest part of my final grade. On top of that, I had to prepare for two final exams that were scheduled in the same week. I was also working a part-time job in a café for about 15 hours a week, so it was a real struggle to fit everything in.

To manage the situation, I had to be incredibly organised. I created a detailed study schedule, breaking down my dissertation into small, manageable chunks. I allocated specific times for studying, writing, and revising for my exams. I also had to be disciplined and cut back on my social life for a few weeks, which was difficult. I remember I had to say no to a friend’s birthday party, which I felt bad about. I made sure to take short breaks to avoid burnout, even if it was just for 15 minutes to go for a walk.

At the time, I felt completely overwhelmed and stressed. There were moments when I thought I wouldn’t be able to get everything done. I was tired and wasn’t sleeping very well. However, when I finally submitted my dissertation and finished my last exam, I felt an incredible sense of relief and accomplishment. It was a very challenging period, but it taught me a lot about time management and my own ability to handle pressure."

#### **Useful Expressions & Fillers (for fluency)**

*   "Okay, so I’d like to talk about..."
*   "It was around... / It was during..."
*   "On top of that..."
*   "To manage the situation, I had to..."
*   "I remember..."
*   "At the time, I felt..."

#### **Fluency Strategy: How to Extend Answers**

*   **Give a reason:** "It's important to manage time effectively **because** it helps to reduce stress."
*   **Give an example:** "Technology can waste time. **For instance,** people spend hours scrolling through social media."
*   **Explain the consequences:** "If companies don't help with work-life balance, **their employees might suffer from burnout**."
*   **Use contrasting ideas:** "**While** some people thrive on being busy, **I prefer** a more relaxed pace."

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (for a Band 5.5–6.0+ score)**

*   **Don’t give very simple answers.** Always try to add more detail and explain your point of view.
*   **Don’t use the same vocabulary all the time.** Try to use synonyms (e.g., "busy," "hectic," "overwhelmed").
*   **Make sure your tenses are correct.** When talking about the past, use past tenses (e.g., "I had to," "I felt").
*   **Don’t be afraid to pause briefly to think.** It is better to pause for a second than to use a lot of filler words like "um" and "er."
