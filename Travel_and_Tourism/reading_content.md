You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1–10**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

### The Rise of the Staycation

In recent years, a significant shift has been observed in holiday trends. Instead of packing their bags for distant, exotic locations, a growing number of people are choosing to explore the attractions available closer to home. This trend, known as a “staycation,” involves taking a holiday in one’s own country rather than travelling abroad. While the concept is not entirely new, its recent surge in popularity can be attributed to a combination of economic, environmental, and social factors.

One of the most compelling reasons for the rise of the staycation is its financial benefit. International travel can be expensive, with costs including airfares, accommodation, and fluctuating currency exchange rates. Staycations eliminate many of these major expenses, allowing individuals and families to enjoy a break without the associated financial strain. A 2022 report by the National Board of Tourism indicated that a family of four could save an average of 60% on their holiday budget by choosing a domestic destination over a foreign one. This saved money can then be spent on local attractions, dining, and shopping, thereby boosting the local economy.

Beyond the economic advantages, there is a growing awareness of the environmental impact of travel. Long-haul flights are a major contributor to carbon emissions, and the concept of “flygskam,” or “flight shame,” has gained traction, particularly in Europe. By opting for a staycation, travellers can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Travel within a country often involves using cars or public transport like trains and buses, which, while not entirely carbon-neutral, generally have a lower environmental impact per person compared to air travel. This eco-conscious mindset is encouraging more people to discover the natural beauty and cultural heritage of their own nation.

Furthermore, the recent global health crisis has played a pivotal role in reshaping travel habits. With international borders closing and the uncertainty of travel restrictions, many people have found that exploring their local area is a more reliable and less stressful option. This has led to a rediscovery of local parks, historical sites, and coastal towns that were previously overlooked in favour of more glamorous international destinations. Many have been pleasantly surprised by the richness and diversity of what their own country has to offer, from breathtaking landscapes to vibrant cultural festivals.

However, the staycation trend is not without its critics. Some argue that it can lead to overcrowding in popular domestic tourist spots, putting a strain on local infrastructure and the environment. Additionally, for those living in smaller countries, the options for a domestic holiday may be limited. Despite these concerns, the movement towards local travel continues to grow, suggesting that for many, the benefits of exploring their own backyard outweigh the lure of a foreign adventure.

### The Art of Responsible Souvenir Shopping

For many travellers, bringing home a souvenir is an essential part of the holiday experience. It is a tangible reminder of the places they have visited and the memories they have made. However, not all souvenirs are created equal. The choices we make in a gift shop can have a significant and often hidden impact on the local environment, economy, and culture. This has led to a growing movement promoting responsible souvenir shopping, which encourages tourists to make choices that are both ethical and sustainable.

**A. The Economic Footprint**
One of the primary arguments for responsible souvenir shopping is its potential to support the local economy directly. When tourists purchase mass-produced trinkets, often imported from other countries, very little of the money spent actually benefits the community they are visiting. In contrast, buying handcrafted goods from local artisans ensures that the profits stay within the community. This provides a vital source of income for skilled craftspeople and helps to preserve traditional skills that might otherwise disappear. Look for markets or cooperatives where you can buy directly from the person who made the item.

**B. Cultural Preservation**
Souvenirs can also play a role in either preserving or eroding local culture. Items that are authentic and reflect the genuine artistic traditions of a region help to keep those traditions alive. For example, buying a hand-woven rug in Morocco or a piece of painted pottery in Mexico supports cultural heritage. Conversely, the demand for cheap, generic souvenirs can lead to the commercialization of culture, where sacred or significant designs are copied onto low-quality products for a quick sale, stripping them of their original meaning.

**C. Environmental Considerations**
Many popular souvenirs are unfortunately made from materials that harm the environment. Products made from endangered species, such as coral, ivory, or certain types of wood, contribute directly to biodiversity loss. Even seemingly harmless items, like shells collected from a beach, can disrupt delicate ecosystems. Responsible tourists should avoid these products and instead look for items made from sustainable, locally sourced materials like recycled glass, renewable wood, or natural fibres.

**D. How to Be a Responsible Shopper**
Becoming a responsible souvenir shopper is not difficult. The first step is to ask questions. Ask the vendor where the product was made and what materials were used. Secondly, prioritise quality over quantity. A single, well-made, authentic item is a far better keepsake than a bag full of cheap, forgettable trinkets. Finally, consider buying consumable souvenirs, such as locally produced coffee, spices, or honey. These are often a delicious and sustainable way to support local farmers and producers, and they won’t end up gathering dust on a shelf.

By thinking more carefully about what we buy, we can transform the simple act of souvenir shopping into a positive force that supports communities, protects the environment, and honours cultural traditions.

### Ecotourism: A Solution for Sustainable Travel?

As the world becomes more interconnected, the tourism industry continues to expand, bringing both economic benefits and environmental challenges. A potential solution to this dilemma is ecotourism, a form of travel that aims to be both sustainable and educational. Defined by The International Ecotourism Society as “responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education,” ecotourism is more than just a trip; it is a philosophy.

The core principles of ecotourism are built around minimizing impact. This involves not only the ‘leave no trace’ mantra, where travellers are expected to leave natural areas exactly as they found them, but also extends to the infrastructure that supports the tourism. Eco-lodges, for example, are often constructed using sustainable, locally sourced materials and are designed to blend in with the surrounding environment. They typically utilize renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and have advanced systems for water conservation and waste management. The goal is to create a travel experience that does not degrade the natural resources that attract visitors in the first place.

Another fundamental aspect of ecotourism is its commitment to the local community. In a conventional tourism model, large international corporations often own the hotels and tour companies, and a significant portion of the profits flows out of the host country. Ecotourism seeks to reverse this trend by empowering local communities. This is achieved by promoting locally owned businesses, hiring local guides, and sourcing food and supplies from local producers. When local people benefit directly from the conservation of their natural environment, they have a powerful incentive to protect it. This creates a symbiotic relationship where both the environment and the community can thrive.

Education is the third pillar of ecotourism. The aim is to provide travellers with a deeper understanding of the area they are visiting. This is not simply about identifying different species of birds or plants; it is about learning about the complex web of life in an ecosystem and the culture of the people who live there. Guided tours are often led by knowledgeable local experts who can share insights into the region’s history, ecology, and conservation challenges. This educational component can transform a simple holiday into a meaningful experience, fostering a greater appreciation for the environment and a lasting commitment to its protection.

Despite its noble intentions, ecotourism is not without its challenges. The term has been so overused and misused that it has sometimes become a victim of “greenwashing,” where companies falsely market their operations as environmentally friendly to attract well-intentioned travellers. True ecotourism requires a genuine commitment from operators and a discerning eye from travellers. Furthermore, even well-managed ecotourism can lead to the gradual erosion of a pristine environment if the volume of visitors is not carefully controlled. Finding the right balance between access and preservation remains a critical challenge for the industry.
