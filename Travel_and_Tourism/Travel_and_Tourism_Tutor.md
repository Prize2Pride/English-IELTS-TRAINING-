## Writing Task 1: Model Answer & Analysis

### The Task

> **The chart below shows the number of tourists visiting a particular country from three different continents between 1995 and 2010.**
>
> **Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

---

### Model Answer (Band 9)

The line graph illustrates the number of tourists, in millions, who visited a specific country from three different continents—Europe, Asia, and North America—over a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010.

Overall, the total number of tourists from these three continents increased significantly, with visitors from Asia showing the most dramatic rise. Tourists from Europe consistently represented the largest group throughout the period, although their numbers experienced a slight dip towards the end.

In 1995, the number of European tourists stood at 10 million, making it the most significant source of visitors. This figure rose steadily to a peak of 15 million in 2005 before declining slightly to 14 million in 2010. In contrast, visitors from North America started at 4 million and saw a gradual but steady increase, reaching 7 million by the end of the period.

The most remarkable trend was the growth in tourists from Asia. Beginning at just 2 million in 1995, the number of Asian visitors quadrupled to 8 million by 2005. This was followed by another sharp increase, with the figure reaching 12 million in 2010. By this point, the number of tourists from Asia was almost double that of North America and was approaching the number of visitors from Europe.

## Writing Task 2: Model Essay & Analysis

### The Task

> **Some people believe that international travel does more harm than good, contributing to environmental problems and the erosion of local culture.**
>
> **To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?**

---

### Model Essay (Band 9)

It is often argued that the growth of international travel is a negative development, primarily due to its detrimental effects on the environment and local cultures. While there is some validity to these concerns, I largely disagree with this statement. I believe that the benefits of international travel, such as fostering cross-cultural understanding and boosting economies, far outweigh the drawbacks, provided that it is managed responsibly.

On the one hand, the arguments against international travel are understandable. The environmental cost is perhaps the most significant concern. The aviation industry is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and the sheer volume of flights today undoubtedly exacerbates climate change. Furthermore, the phenomenon of 'overtourism' can place immense strain on the infrastructure of popular destinations, leading to pollution and the degradation of natural landscapes. Culturally, the arrival of mass tourism can lead to the commercialization of traditions, where authentic customs are turned into superficial shows for visitors, thereby losing their original meaning.

However, these negative impacts are not an inevitable consequence of travel itself, but rather of poorly managed tourism. When practiced sustainably, travel can be a powerful force for good. Economically, tourism is a vital source of income for many countries, creating jobs and supporting local businesses from small guesthouses to artisan craft markets. This can provide a strong incentive for communities to preserve their natural and cultural heritage, as it becomes a valuable economic asset.

Moreover, the most profound benefit of international travel is its ability to build bridges between different cultures. When people travel, they are exposed to new perspectives, traditions, and ways of life, which can challenge stereotypes and promote mutual respect and understanding. In an increasingly globalized world, this form of direct, personal experience is invaluable for fostering a sense of global community. A traveller who has shared a meal with a family in Vietnam or learned about local history from a guide in Peru is likely to have a more nuanced and empathetic worldview.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential environmental and cultural damage associated with international travel, I firmly believe that these are challenges to be managed, not reasons to condemn the practice entirely. Through sustainable practices and a focus on authentic cultural exchange, international travel can be an overwhelmingly positive force for individuals and the world at large.

## Speaking Section: Guidance for Tutors

### Part 2: Cue Card - Key Points to Listen For

When assessing a student's response to the Part 2 cue card ("Describe a journey that didn't go as planned"), look for the following:

*   **Task Achievement:** Did the student cover all four bullet points (where, what went wrong, what they did, how they felt)?
*   **Fluency:** Did the student speak continuously for 1-2 minutes without long pauses?
*   **Coherence:** Was the story logical and easy to follow?
*   **Vocabulary:** Did the student use a range of vocabulary related to travel and emotions?
*   **Grammar:** Did the student use a variety of tenses (past simple, past continuous, past perfect) correctly?

### Part 3: Discussion - Suggested Follow-Up Questions

*   "You mentioned that technology has changed travel. Do you think this is always a positive thing?"
*   "What responsibilities do you think tourists have when they visit a new place?"
*   "Do you think governments should limit the number of tourists visiting certain places?"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid (for a Band 5.5–6.0+ score)

| Mistake | Advice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Giving very short answers** | Always try to extend your answer by giving a reason, an example, or a comparison. |
| **Memorizing long, scripted answers** | Examiners can easily spot this. It sounds unnatural and will lower your score. |
| **Using overly complex vocabulary incorrectly** | It's better to use simpler words correctly than to make errors with difficult words. |
| **Stopping speaking in Part 2** | Keep talking until the examiner says "Thank you." If you finish your story, add more details or talk about related points. |
