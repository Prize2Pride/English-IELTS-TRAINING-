# Tutor & Writing Guide: Travel and Tourism

### **Writing Task 1: Model Answer & Analysis**

**Model Answer (Band 9)**

The line graph illustrates the number of tourists, in millions, who visited a specific country from three different continents—Europe, Asia, and North America—over a 15-year period between 1995 and 2010.

Overall, the total number of tourists from these three continents increased significantly, with visitors from Asia showing the most dramatic rise. Tourists from Europe consistently represented the largest group throughout the period, although their numbers experienced a slight dip towards the end.

In 1995, the number of European tourists stood at 10 million, making it the most significant source of visitors. This figure rose steadily to a peak of 15 million in 2005 before declining slightly to 14 million in 2010. In contrast, visitors from North America started at 4 million and saw a gradual but steady increase, reaching 7 million by the end of the period.

The most remarkable trend was the growth in tourists from Asia. Beginning at just 2 million in 1995, the number of Asian visitors quadrupled to 8 million by 2005. This was followed by another sharp increase, with the figure reaching 12 million in 2010. By this point, the number of tourists from Asia was almost double that of North America and was approaching the number of visitors from Europe.

**Analysis of Key Features:**
*   **Introduction:** Paraphrases the question effectively.
*   **Overview:** Clearly states the main trends (overall increase, Asia's dramatic growth, Europe's dominance).
*   **Body Paragraphs:** Groups information logically (Europe & North America together, Asia separately). Uses specific data from the chart to support the description.
*   **Vocabulary:** Uses a good range of vocabulary to describe trends (e.g., *increased significantly, dramatic rise, consistently represented, rose steadily, a peak, declining slightly, gradual but steady increase, remarkable trend, quadrupled, sharp increase*).

### **Writing Task 2: Model Essay (Band 9)**

**Model Essay**

It is often argued that the growth of international travel is a negative development, primarily due to its detrimental effects on the environment and local cultures. While there is some validity to these concerns, I largely disagree with this statement. I believe that the benefits of international travel, such as fostering cross-cultural understanding and boosting economies, far outweigh the drawbacks, provided that it is managed responsibly.

On the one hand, the arguments against international travel are understandable. The environmental cost is perhaps the most significant concern. The aviation industry is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, and the sheer volume of flights today undoubtedly exacerbates climate change. Furthermore, the phenomenon of ‘overtourism’ can place immense strain on the infrastructure of popular destinations, leading to pollution and the degradation of natural landscapes. Culturally, the arrival of mass tourism can lead to the commercialization of traditions, where authentic customs are turned into superficial shows for visitors, thereby losing their original meaning.

However, these negative impacts are not an inevitable consequence of travel itself, but rather of poorly managed tourism. When practiced sustainably, travel can be a powerful force for good. Economically, tourism is a vital source of income for many countries, creating jobs and supporting local businesses from small guesthouses to artisan craft markets. This can provide a strong incentive for communities to preserve their natural and cultural heritage, as it becomes a valuable economic asset.

Moreover, the most profound benefit of international travel is its ability to build bridges between different cultures. When people travel, they are exposed to new perspectives, traditions, and ways of life, which can challenge stereotypes and promote mutual respect and understanding. In an increasingly globalized world, this form of direct, personal experience is invaluable for fostering a sense of global community. A traveller who has shared a meal with a family in Vietnam or learned about local history from a guide in Peru is likely to have a more nuanced and empathetic worldview.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential environmental and cultural damage associated with international travel, I firmly believe that these are challenges to be managed, not reasons to condemn the practice entirely. Through sustainable practices and a focus on authentic cultural exchange, international travel can be an overwhelmingly positive force for individuals and the world at large.

**Examiner Tips:**
*   **Clear Stance:** The essay clearly states the author's opinion in the introduction and maintains it throughout.
*   **Balanced Argument:** It addresses the opposing view (the 'harm') before developing its main argument (the 'good').
*   **Strong Structure:** Each paragraph has a clear topic and is well-developed with supporting ideas.
*   **Linking Words:** Uses a good range of linking words and phrases to connect ideas (e.g., *On the one hand, Furthermore, However, Moreover, In conclusion*).
*   **Relevant Examples:** Uses relevant examples to support its points (e.g., overtourism, aviation emissions, sharing a meal with a local family).
