### **Band 6 Model Answers & Useful Language**

#### **Part 2 Model Answer**

"Okay, so I’d like to talk about a time when a simple trip to the coast went completely wrong. I was going to a seaside town called Whitby, which is in the north of England. I was travelling with my friend, and we were going by train for a day trip. We had planned everything – we had our train tickets, a list of things we wanted to see, and we were really looking forward to it.

The problem started when our first train was delayed. It was only by about 20 minutes, so we weren’t too worried. But then, when we got to the main station to change trains, we found out that the connecting train to Whitby had been cancelled due to a technical problem on the line. There wasn’t another one for three hours.

As a result, we had to make a new plan quickly. We looked at the departure board and saw there was a train leaving for the city of York in about 15 minutes. We had both never been to York before, so we just decided to go there instead. It was a spontaneous decision. We bought new tickets and jumped on the train.

Honestly, at first, I felt really disappointed and frustrated. Our whole day was ruined. But when we got to York, my feelings started to change. It was a beautiful city with so much history. We walked around the ancient city walls, visited the huge cathedral, and explored the old, narrow streets. We ended up having a fantastic day, even though it was not the day we had planned. It taught me that sometimes, unexpected changes can lead to a better adventure. I felt quite proud that we managed to turn a bad situation into a really positive and memorable experience."

#### **Useful Expressions & Fillers (for fluency)**

*   "Okay, so I’d like to talk about..."
*   "Let me think..."
*   "The first thing that comes to mind is..."
*   "Honestly, at first, I felt..."
*   "But then, my feelings started to change."
*   "What I mean is..."
*   "I suppose the main reason is..."

#### **Fluency Strategy: How to Extend Answers**

*   **Give a reason:** "I prefer to travel with friends **because** it feels safer and more fun."
*   **Give an example:** "Unexpected problems can be fun. **For instance,** when we missed our train, we discovered a new city."
*   **Explain the alternative:** "Some people love detailed plans, **but I prefer** to be more spontaneous and flexible."
*   **Talk about the past/future:** "Technology has changed travel a lot. **In the past,** you needed paper maps, **but now** everyone uses their phone."

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (for a Band 5.5–6.0+ score)**

*   **Don't give very short, 'yes' or 'no' answers in Part 1 & 3.** Always try to add a reason or an example.
*   **Don't memorize long, perfect answers.** It sounds unnatural. It's better to be fluent and make a few small mistakes.
*   **Don't worry too much about using very complex vocabulary.** It's more important to use the vocabulary you know correctly and clearly.
*   **Don't stop speaking in Part 2 before the examiner tells you to.** Keep talking until they say "Thank you."
