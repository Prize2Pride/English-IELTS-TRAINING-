**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Evolution of Prison Reform**

The concept of imprisoning individuals as a primary form of punishment is a relatively modern development in the history of justice. For centuries, societies relied on more immediate and corporeal forms of retribution, such as public humiliation, corporal punishment, and capital punishment. It was not until the 18th century that the idea of the penitentiary began to take shape, born from a desire for a more humane and enlightened approach to criminal justice. These early prisons were envisioned as places for criminals to engage in religious self-reflection and penance, with the ultimate goal of personal reform. However, the reality of these institutions was often far from this idealistic vision. Early prisons were rife with corruption, and inmates, who included both felons and debtors, were often forced to pay for basic necessities like food and lodging. 

The 19th century saw the emergence of more systematic efforts at prison reform, largely driven by the work of social reformers and religious groups. In the United States, two competing models of prison administration emerged: the Pennsylvania system and the Auburn system. The Pennsylvania system, championed by the Quakers, emphasized solitary confinement as a means of encouraging penance and preventing the corrupting influence of other prisoners. In contrast, the Auburn system, developed in New York, allowed for congregate labor during the day while maintaining solitary confinement at night. This model, which was seen as more cost-effective and conducive to vocational training, ultimately became the dominant model in the United States and much of the world.

Despite these reforms, by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many prisons had become overcrowded, violent, and largely ineffective at rehabilitating offenders. The focus shifted from reform to punishment, and the prevailing ethos was one of "hard labor, hard fare, and a hard bed." This punitive approach did little to reduce recidivism, and in many cases, may have exacerbated the problem. It was not until the mid-20th century that a renewed interest in rehabilitation began to take hold, with a growing recognition that addressing the root causes of criminal behavior, such as poverty, lack of education, and mental illness, was essential to reducing crime in the long run.

Today, the debate over prison reform continues, with a wide range of competing philosophies and approaches. Some advocate for a greater emphasis on restorative justice, which seeks to repair the harm caused by crime by bringing together victims, offenders, and community members. Others focus on the importance of evidence-based practices, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and vocational training, which have been shown to be effective in reducing recidivism. Still others argue for more radical changes, such as the decriminalization of certain offenses and the decarceration of non-violent offenders. While there is no single solution to the complex challenges of prison reform, there is a growing consensus that a more humane, effective, and just approach to criminal justice is urgently needed.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Effectiveness of Rehabilitation**

**A**
The debate over the effectiveness of prison rehabilitation programs is as old as the concept of prison reform itself. While the idea of rehabilitating offenders and preparing them for a successful return to society is a noble one, the practical application of this ideal has been fraught with challenges. For much of the 20th century, the prevailing wisdom was that “nothing works” when it comes to rehabilitating criminals. This pessimistic view was largely based on a series of influential studies that found little evidence that rehabilitation programs had any significant impact on recidivism rates. However, in recent decades, a growing body of research has begun to challenge this long-held assumption, suggesting that well-designed and properly implemented rehabilitation programs can, in fact, be effective in reducing reoffending.

**B**
One of the most promising approaches to prison rehabilitation is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing the negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to criminal activity. By helping offenders to develop new coping skills, problem-solving abilities, and a more positive outlook on life, CBT can empower them to make better choices and avoid future criminal behavior. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT in reducing recidivism, with some meta-analyses reporting reductions of up to 30%. The key to the success of CBT lies in its focus on addressing the underlying cognitive deficits that are common among offenders, such as impulsivity, a lack of empathy, and a tendency to blame others for their problems.

**C**
Another critical component of effective rehabilitation is education and vocational training. Many offenders lack the basic educational qualifications and job skills necessary to secure stable employment upon release from prison. This lack of opportunity can be a major contributing factor to recidivism, as it can lead to a cycle of poverty and despair. By providing offenders with the opportunity to earn a high school diploma, learn a trade, or even pursue a college degree, prisons can equip them with the tools they need to build a better future for themselves. Research has shown that inmates who participate in correctional education programs have significantly lower odds of returning to prison than those who do not.

**D**
In addition to CBT and educational programs, substance abuse treatment is another essential element of a comprehensive rehabilitation strategy. A large percentage of offenders have a history of substance abuse, and this is often a major contributing factor to their criminal behavior. Effective substance abuse treatment programs, such as therapeutic communities and 12-step programs, can help offenders to address their addiction and develop the skills they need to maintain sobriety upon release. By breaking the cycle of addiction, these programs can significantly reduce the likelihood of reoffending.

**E**
While there is growing evidence that rehabilitation programs can be effective, it is important to note that not all programs are created equal. The effectiveness of a program depends on a variety of factors, including the quality of the program, the characteristics of the offenders, and the context in which the program is delivered. For example, programs that are based on the principles of risk, need, and responsivity (RNR) have been shown to be particularly effective. The RNR model emphasizes the importance of targeting high-risk offenders, addressing their specific criminogenic needs, and using a cognitive-behavioral approach that is tailored to their individual learning styles.

**F**
Ultimately, the success of prison rehabilitation depends on a holistic and individualized approach that addresses the complex needs of offenders. By combining evidence-based practices like CBT, education, and substance abuse treatment with a supportive and structured environment, prisons can help offenders to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. While the challenges are significant, the potential rewards – in terms of reduced crime, increased public safety, and improved lives – are immeasurable.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**Beyond Bars: The Promise of Alternatives to Incarceration**

The traditional model of criminal justice, with its emphasis on incarceration as the primary means of punishment, is facing a growing chorus of criticism. Skyrocketing incarceration rates, the immense financial burden of maintaining prisons, and the limited effectiveness of imprisonment in reducing recidivism have led many to question the wisdom of our current approach. As a result, there is a growing interest in alternatives to incarceration (ATIs), which offer a more humane, cost-effective, and potentially more effective way of responding to crime.

ATIs encompass a wide range of programs and sanctions that are designed to hold offenders accountable for their actions while addressing the underlying causes of their criminal behavior. These can include community-based sanctions, such as probation, community service, and electronic monitoring, as well as restorative justice programs, which seek to repair the harm caused by crime by bringing together victims, offenders, and community members. The common thread that unites these diverse approaches is a commitment to diverting offenders from the traditional prison system and providing them with the support and supervision they need to lead law-abiding lives.

One of the most compelling arguments for ATIs is their potential to reduce the staggering financial costs of mass incarceration. The cost of incarcerating an individual for a single year can be tens of thousands of dollars, and with millions of people currently behind bars in the United States alone, the total cost is astronomical. ATIs, on the other hand, are typically far less expensive to administer. For example, the cost of supervising an offender on probation is a fraction of the cost of incarcerating them. By diverting non-violent offenders from prison and into community-based programs, we can free up much-needed resources that can be reinvested in education, healthcare, and other vital public services.

Beyond the financial benefits, ATIs also offer a more effective way of promoting public safety. While prisons are often seen as a necessary tool for incapacitating dangerous offenders, the reality is that the vast majority of people in prison will eventually be released back into the community. If they have not been provided with the tools and support they need to succeed, they are likely to reoffend, creating a revolving door of crime and incarceration. ATIs, by contrast, are designed to address the root causes of criminal behavior and provide offenders with the skills and resources they need to become productive members of society. By focusing on rehabilitation rather than simply punishment, ATIs can help to break the cycle of crime and create safer communities for everyone.

Of course, ATIs are not a panacea. They are not appropriate for all offenders, and there will always be a need for prisons to house violent and dangerous criminals. However, for a large percentage of the prison population, particularly those who have committed non-violent offenses, ATIs offer a more promising path forward. By embracing a more balanced and evidence-based approach to criminal justice, one that combines accountability with rehabilitation, we can create a system that is not only more just and humane, but also more effective in promoting public safety.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning, everyone. My name is Dr. David Clarke, and I’m a criminologist. I’m here today to talk to you about the importance of prison reform. For too long, our criminal justice system has been focused on punishment rather than rehabilitation. We’ve built more and more prisons, and we’ve locked up more and more people, but we haven’t seen a corresponding decrease in crime. In fact, in many cases, the opposite is true. The current prison system is in need of major changes.

I believe that rehabilitation programs are essential for reducing recidivism. When we provide offenders with the education, job training, and mental health treatment they need, we empower them to turn their lives around and become productive members of society. It’s not about being “soft on crime.” It’s about being smart on crime. It’s about investing in what works.

Of course, rehabilitation is not a magic bullet. It’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. But it is a crucial part of a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime and promoting public safety. We need to move away from a purely punitive approach and embrace a more holistic and evidence-based approach to criminal justice.

Now, I’d like to talk about some of the specific aspects of prison reform that I believe are most important. First and foremost, we need to prioritize education and vocational training. This is a top priority. We also need to address the mental health needs of offenders. This is another area that is important but has its limitations. Restorative justice is also a promising approach, but it is not a major focus of my work. And finally, we need to explore alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders. This is another top priority. But none of this will be possible without greater public awareness and support. We need to have a more informed and honest conversation about crime and punishment in this country.

**SECTION 3**

**Anna:** So, what did you think of the lecture on the sociology of crime?
**Ben:** I thought it was really interesting and thought-provoking. It gave me a lot to think about.
**Anna:** Me too. I was particularly interested in the concept of rehabilitation. I think it’s something that we don’t talk about enough.
**Ben:** I agree. It seems like the whole focus of the criminal justice system is on punishment, but we know that doesn’t always work.
**Anna:** Exactly. I was a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of restorative justice, though. It sounds good in theory, but I’m not sure how it would work in practice.
**Ben:** I see your point, but I think it’s worth exploring. It seems like a much more humane and constructive approach than just locking people up and throwing away the key.
**Anna:** I suppose so. I just think that the criminal justice system should be more focused on addressing the root causes of crime, like poverty and inequality.
**Ben:** I completely agree. So, what are you going to write your essay on?
**Anna:** I’m going to focus on the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs. I think it’s a really important topic.
**Ben:** That sounds great. I’m going to write about the future of criminal justice. I think it will be challenging but rewarding.
**Anna:** I’m sure it will be. It’s a great opportunity to learn more about the topic.
**Ben:** Do you want to work on the essay together?
**Anna:** I think we should probably work on our own essays, but we could meet again to discuss our ideas.
**Ben:** Good idea. I’m really interested in researching the psychological effects of imprisonment.
**Anna:** Me too. I hope our essays will contribute to the debate on prison reform.
**Ben:** I hope so too. And I hope we get a good grade!

**SECTION 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at the future of prison reform. As we’ve discussed in previous lectures, the current prison system is facing a number of significant challenges. We have high rates of recidivism, overcrowded and expensive prisons, and a lack of focus on rehabilitation. So, what’s the solution? I believe that we need a new model of justice, one that is focused on prevention and community-based sanctions. We need to invest in evidence-based programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing reoffending. And we need to place a greater emphasis on restorative justice.

The key principles of this new model are accountability, restoration, and reintegration. Offenders must take responsibility for their actions, but they must also be given the opportunity to repair the harm they have caused and to become productive members of society. Of course, there are a number of challenges to implementing this new model. There is often political opposition to change, a lack of public funding, and a great deal of public skepticism.

However, I believe that technology can play a key role in overcoming some of these challenges. Electronic monitoring can be used to supervise offenders in the community, online learning can provide inmates with access to education and job training, and data analysis can be used to improve decision-making and resource allocation. In conclusion, I believe that a more humane, just, and effective criminal justice system is possible. But it will require a fundamental shift in our thinking about crime and punishment.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of inmates in a specific European country who engaged in four different rehabilitation programs—Education, Vocational Training, Substance Abuse Treatment, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy—in the years 2010 and 2020.

Overall, participation in all four types of rehabilitation programs increased over the decade. Vocational Training was the most popular program in both years, while Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy consistently had the lowest participation rates.

In 2010, 35% of the prison population participated in Vocational Training, making it the most sought-after program. This figure rose to 40% in 2020. Participation in Education programs also saw a modest increase, from 25% in 2010 to 30% in 2020. 

The most significant increases in participation were observed in Substance Abuse Treatment and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. The percentage of inmates in Substance Abuse Treatment programs grew from 20% in 2010 to 35% in 2020, a substantial rise of 15 percentage points. Similarly, participation in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy more than doubled, from 10% in 2010 to 25% in 2020, although it remained the least popular option of the four.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The most effective method for reducing crime is a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for the deterrent effect of longer prison sentences, others contend that alternative approaches are more successful in the long run. This essay will discuss both perspectives before arguing that a multi-faceted approach, which prioritizes rehabilitation and addresses the root causes of crime, is ultimately more effective than a purely punitive one.

Proponents of longer prison sentences argue that they serve as a powerful deterrent, discouraging potential offenders from committing crimes for fear of the consequences. The logic is that if the punishment is severe enough, individuals will be less likely to break the law. Furthermore, lengthy sentences incapacitate offenders, preventing them from committing further crimes while they are incarcerated. This perspective emphasizes the importance of retribution and public safety, suggesting that those who commit serious crimes should be removed from society for an extended period. While there is some merit to this argument, particularly for violent and dangerous offenders, it fails to address the underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior.

On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests that alternative approaches to crime reduction are more effective and humane. These alternatives, which include rehabilitation programs, community-based sanctions, and restorative justice, focus on addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and substance abuse. By providing offenders with the tools and support they need to reintegrate into society, these programs can help to break the cycle of crime and incarceration. For example, studies have shown that inmates who participate in educational and vocational programs are significantly less likely to reoffend upon release. This approach recognizes that most offenders will eventually return to the community, and that it is in society’s best interest to ensure that they are equipped to lead productive, law-abiding lives.

In my view, while longer prison sentences may be necessary for a small minority of dangerous criminals, a far more effective long-term strategy is to invest in a range of alternatives to incarceration. A purely punitive approach not only fails to address the underlying causes of crime but also creates a revolving door of reoffending. By contrast, a holistic approach that combines accountability with rehabilitation offers a more promising path towards a safer and more just society. This involves not only investing in effective programs within prisons but also strengthening community-based support systems to prevent individuals from turning to crime in the first place.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

The social issue that I learned about recently, which was quite new to me, is the concept of restorative justice. I came across it while watching a documentary about prison reform in New Zealand. The documentary featured a powerful story of a young man who had committed a serious assault and was given the opportunity to meet with his victim as part of a restorative justice conference.

I learned that restorative justice is a very different approach to the traditional criminal justice system. Instead of focusing on punishment, it focuses on repairing the harm caused by crime. It brings together the victim, the offender, and community members to discuss the impact of the crime and to decide on a plan for how the offender can make amends. In the documentary, I saw how the young man was able to understand the true impact of his actions and how the victim was able to get answers to her questions and to feel a sense of closure.

I think that restorative justice is a very powerful tool that should be used more widely. It’s not appropriate for every case, of course, but I think it has the potential to be much more effective than simply sending people to prison. It can help to reduce reoffending by making offenders take responsibility for their actions, and it can help victims to heal and move on with their lives. I believe that we should invest more in restorative justice programs and make them a more central part of our criminal justice system.
