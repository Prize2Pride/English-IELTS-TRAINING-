### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**Reading Passage 1**

The world is drowning in plastic. Since its mass production began in the 1950s, plastic has become an inescapable part of modern life. Its durability, low cost, and versatility have made it a ubiquitous material in everything from packaging and construction to clothing and electronics. However, these same qualities have also turned it into a persistent and pervasive pollutant, creating a global environmental crisis that threatens ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. The sheer scale of the problem is staggering. Global plastic production has skyrocketed from a mere two million tonnes in 1950 to over 450 million tonnes annually today. Alarmingly, it is estimated that half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 20 years. A significant portion of this plastic is designed for single-use, with over 50% of plastic products being used just once and then thrown away. This throwaway culture has resulted in an enormous amount of waste, much of which is not properly managed.

Every year, an estimated 19-23 million tonnes of plastic waste leak into aquatic ecosystems, polluting lakes, rivers, and seas. This plastic debris is a major threat to marine life. Animals can become entangled in larger plastic items, leading to injury, drowning, or suffocation. Many species also mistake smaller plastic fragments for food. Ingesting plastic can cause internal injuries, blockages, and starvation. Over one in three fish caught for human consumption now contains plastic, and the presence of plastic has been documented in a wide range of marine organisms, from tiny plankton to large whales. The problem is not limited to the oceans. Plastic pollution also contaminates terrestrial environments, with plastic debris found in soils, freshwater sources, and even in the air we breathe. The long-term consequences of this widespread contamination are still not fully understood, but the potential risks to ecosystems and human health are a growing concern.

The vast majority of plastic, over 98%, is derived from fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. The production of plastic is therefore a significant contributor to climate change. The entire lifecycle of plastic, from the extraction of raw materials to its refinement and disposal, releases greenhouse gases. The refinement of plastics alone emits an estimated 184 to 213 million metric tons of greenhouse gases each year. Furthermore, when plastic waste is incinerated, it releases carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Landfills are also a source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as plastic waste slowly degrades. The connection between plastic pollution and climate change is a critical aspect of the environmental crisis we face, and it highlights the need for a more holistic approach to solving the problem.

This pollution is a serious threat to wildlife and potentially to human health. Furthermore, the production of plastic from **13** __________ is a major contributor to climate change.


**Reading Passage 2**

**A**

Addressing the global plastic pollution crisis requires a multi-faceted approach that involves individuals, corporations, and governments. While the scale of the problem can seem overwhelming, a growing number of innovative solutions are being developed and implemented around the world. These solutions range from grassroots community initiatives to high-tech international projects, all aimed at reducing the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our environment. The key to success lies in a combination of reducing our consumption of plastic, improving waste management systems, and developing new technologies to clean up existing pollution.

**B**

One of the most promising strategies for tackling plastic pollution is the concept of a circular economy. In a circular economy, materials are not simply used once and then thrown away. Instead, they are designed to be reused, repaired, and recycled, creating a closed-loop system that minimizes waste and pollution. This approach requires a fundamental shift in how we produce and consume goods. For example, companies are exploring new business models based on refillable and reusable packaging, while designers are creating products that are easier to disassemble and recycle. The transition to a circular economy is a complex and long-term process, but it offers a powerful framework for a more sustainable future.

**C**

Technological innovation is also playing a crucial role in the fight against plastic pollution. One of the most well-known examples is The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit organization that is developing advanced technologies to remove plastic from the world's oceans. Their systems use long, floating barriers to concentrate plastic debris, which can then be collected and removed. In addition to large-scale cleanup operations, new technologies are also being developed to improve recycling processes. For instance, chemical recycling techniques can break down plastics into their original molecular components, which can then be used to create new plastics of the same quality. These technologies have the potential to significantly increase recycling rates and reduce our reliance on virgin plastic production.

**D**

While technology offers exciting possibilities, policy and legislation are essential for driving systemic change. Governments around the world are beginning to take action by implementing bans on single-use plastics, such as plastic bags, straws, and cutlery. These bans have been shown to be effective in reducing plastic consumption and encouraging the use of alternatives. In addition to bans, governments can also use economic incentives, such as taxes on plastic packaging, to encourage businesses to reduce their plastic footprint. International cooperation is also crucial, as plastic pollution is a transboundary problem that requires a coordinated global response. The ongoing negotiations for a legally binding global plastics treaty are a significant step in this direction.

**E**

Community-led initiatives are another vital component of the solution. Across the globe, local groups are organizing beach cleanups, waste audits, and educational campaigns to raise awareness and promote behavior change. These grassroots efforts are not only helping to remove plastic from the environment but are also empowering communities to take ownership of the problem. By fostering a sense of collective responsibility, these initiatives can create a ripple effect that inspires wider action and puts pressure on corporations and governments to do more.

**F**

Ultimately, individual actions, when multiplied across a large population, can have a significant impact. Simple changes in our daily habits, such as carrying a reusable water bottle, using cloth shopping bags, and avoiding products with excessive plastic packaging, can collectively reduce the demand for single-use plastics. By making more conscious choices as consumers, we can send a powerful message to businesses that we want more sustainable products and services. The journey to a plastic-free world is a long one, but it is a journey that we must all embark on together.

**Reading Passage 3**

The pervasive nature of plastic pollution extends far beyond the visible debris that clutters our landscapes and oceans. Microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than five millimeters in size, have infiltrated every corner of the globe, from the deepest sea trenches to the highest mountain peaks. They are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. This invisible onslaught of microplastics poses a significant and growing threat to human health, with emerging research revealing a host of potential adverse effects. The very properties that make plastic so useful – its durability and resistance to degradation – also make it a persistent and insidious contaminant in the human body.

Microplastics can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Once inside, they can accumulate in various organs, including the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Studies have shown that these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier and even the placental barrier, exposing the developing fetus to potential harm. The health risks associated with microplastic exposure are multifaceted. The particles themselves can cause physical damage to tissues and trigger inflammatory responses. Furthermore, plastics often contain a cocktail of chemical additives, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), which are known endocrine disruptors. These chemicals can leach from the plastic particles and interfere with the body's hormonal systems, potentially leading to a range of health problems, including reproductive disorders, developmental issues, and an increased risk of certain cancers.

In addition to the chemicals they contain, microplastics can also act as vectors for other harmful pollutants. They can absorb and concentrate toxic substances from the surrounding environment, such as heavy metals and pesticides. When these contaminated particles are ingested or inhaled, they can deliver a concentrated dose of toxins to the body. The long-term consequences of this chronic exposure are still largely unknown, but there is growing concern among scientists that it could contribute to a wide range of chronic diseases. The ubiquity of microplastics in our environment means that everyone is exposed, but the level of risk may vary depending on factors such as geographic location, diet, and occupation.

The socio-economic dimensions of plastic pollution are also a critical aspect of the crisis. The burden of plastic waste is often disproportionately borne by marginalized communities and developing countries. Many developed nations export their plastic waste to developing countries, where it is often managed in informal and unsafe conditions. This practice not only externalizes the environmental and health costs of plastic consumption but also creates a new form of environmental injustice. Communities living near plastic waste dumps and recycling facilities are exposed to a host of toxic emissions, and workers in the informal recycling sector often face hazardous conditions with little or no protection.

The fight against plastic pollution is therefore not just an environmental issue but also a matter of social justice. It requires a systemic approach that addresses the entire lifecycle of plastic, from production to disposal. This includes reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, investing in sustainable alternatives, and holding corporations accountable for the waste they produce. It also means supporting policies that promote a just transition to a circular economy, one that protects the health and well-being of all communities, not just the privileged few. The invisible threat of microplastics and the glaring inequalities of the plastic waste trade are two sides of the same coin, and both must be addressed if we are to create a truly sustainable and equitable future.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is John Carter, and I'm the head of waste management for the local council. I'm here today to talk to you about our new and improved recycling scheme, which we're launching next month. As you know, plastic pollution is a major environmental problem, and we're committed to doing our part to tackle it. That's why we're introducing a new system that will make it easier for you to recycle more of your plastic waste.

The main change is that we're introducing new, larger recycling bins. These bins will be able to hold a wider range of plastics than our current bins. In addition to plastic bottles, you'll now be able to recycle yogurt pots, margarine tubs, and food trays. However, please note that we are still unable to accept plastic bags or film. These items can cause problems at the recycling plant, so please continue to dispose of them in your general waste bin.

We believe that this new scheme has the potential to significantly increase our recycling rates, but its success ultimately depends on you, the community. We need everyone to get on board and make a conscious effort to recycle as much as possible. To help you, we've set up a number of collection points around the town. The main collection point is at the supermarket, which is open 24 hours a day. There are also collection points at the library, the community centre, the park, and the school. Please note that the collection point at the library has limited opening hours, and the one at the school is for residents of that area only. We've also set up a special container for batteries at the community centre, so please make use of that.

We're confident that with your help, we can make a real difference to our local environment. Thank you for your time, and I'm now happy to answer any questions you may have.

**SECTION 3**

**Dr. Evans:** Hi David, Chloe. Come in and take a seat. So, you're here to discuss your project on plastic pollution. How's it going?

**Chloe:** It's going well, Dr. Evans. We've done a lot of initial reading, but we're a bit worried that the topic is too broad.

**Dr. Evans:** I see. That's a common problem. What aspects of the topic are you most interested in?

**David:** Well, I'm particularly interested in the social impacts of plastic waste. You know, how it affects different communities around the world.

**Chloe:** And I'm more interested in the solutions, especially the role of technology and the concept of a circular economy.

**Dr. Evans:** Those are both excellent areas to focus on. I suggest you narrow your project down to a specific case study. For example, you could look at the impact of plastic pollution on a particular community and then explore the potential solutions in that context.

**Chloe:** That's a great idea. But I'm a bit concerned about finding reliable data for a specific case study.

**Dr. Evans:** That's a valid point. I recommend you start by reading the book 'The Plastic Crisis' by Professor Williams. It provides a comprehensive overview of the issue and has some excellent case studies. It argues that a circular economy is the only long-term solution, which I think you'll find interesting.

**David:** 'The Plastic Crisis' by Professor Williams. Got it. So, how should we divide the research?

**Chloe:** I think it would be best if we focus on different aspects of the topic. I can research the solutions, and you can focus on the social impacts.

**David:** That sounds good to me. What's our next step?

**Dr. Evans:** I suggest you create a detailed outline for your project. That will help you to structure your research and ensure that you cover all the key points. And remember to be critical of your sources. Don't just accept everything you read at face value.

**Chloe:** Okay, we'll do that. Thanks for your help, Dr. Evans.

**Dr. Evans:** You're welcome. I look forward to seeing your outline next week.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning everyone. Today, I'm going to be talking about bioplastics. Now, when we hear the term 'bioplastic', we often think of a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastics. But is that really the case? Well, the reality is a bit more complex.

First of all, what are bioplastics? Broadly speaking, they are plastics derived from renewable sources, such as corn starch or sugarcane. They are often promoted as a more sustainable alternative to conventional plastics, which are made from fossil fuels. However, it's important to understand that there are different types of bioplastics. Some are bio-based, meaning they are made from renewable materials, but they are not necessarily biodegradable. Others are biodegradable, meaning they can be broken down by microorganisms, but they may be made from fossil fuels. And some plastics are both bio-based and biodegradable.

So, what are the benefits of bioplastics? Well, the main advantage is that they can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. They can also have a lower carbon footprint than conventional plastics, although this is not always the case. And if they are properly managed, they have the potential to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our environment.

However, there are also a number of challenges and criticisms associated with bioplastics. One of the main concerns is land use. Growing crops for bioplastics can compete with food production, which could lead to higher food prices and food shortages. Another issue is biodegradability. Many bioplastics only biodegrade in specific industrial composting conditions, which are not widely available. If they end up in landfill or the open environment, they can persist for just as long as conventional plastics. They can also contaminate recycling streams if they are not disposed of correctly. And the term 'bioplastic' itself can be misleading to consumers, who may assume that all bioplastics are good for the environment.

So, what is the future of bioplastics? Well, there is a clear need for better standards and labeling to help consumers make informed choices. There is also a lot of research into developing new types of bioplastics from waste materials, such as food waste and agricultural waste. But ultimately, it's important to take a holistic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of the product, from the raw materials to its disposal. Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The provided bar chart illustrates the fate of global plastic waste. Overall, it is immediately clear that the vast majority of plastic is not recycled, with discarding and mismanagement being the most common methods of disposal.

According to the chart, almost half of all plastic waste, 46%, is discarded. This is the largest single category, indicating that a significant proportion of plastic is simply thrown away. A further 22% of plastic waste is mismanaged, which leads to it becoming plastic pollution in the environment. Together, these two categories account for over two-thirds of all plastic waste, highlighting the scale of the global pollution problem.

In contrast, only a small fraction of plastic waste is recycled. The chart shows that just 13% of plastic is recycled, which is the smallest proportion of the four categories. Incineration is slightly more common, accounting for 19% of plastic waste disposal. This suggests that while some efforts are being made to manage plastic waste more sustainably, they are still far outweighed by less environmentally friendly methods.

In conclusion, the chart reveals a concerning picture of global plastic waste management. The low recycling rate and the high proportion of discarded and mismanaged waste underscore the urgent need for more effective solutions to the plastic pollution crisis.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9)

Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, and there is a growing debate about the most effective way to address it. Some argue that governments should take the lead by imposing a blanket ban on all single-use plastic products. Others, however, contend that the onus is on individuals to change their consumption habits. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering my own view that a combination of government intervention and individual responsibility is required.

On the one hand, there is a strong case to be made for government-led action. Proponents of this view argue that individual efforts, while well-intentioned, are insufficient to tackle the sheer scale of the problem. A legally binding ban on single-use plastics, such as bags, straws, and cutlery, would have an immediate and significant impact on the amount of plastic waste generated. This approach would also force corporations to innovate and develop more sustainable alternatives, thereby driving systemic change throughout the economy. Furthermore, governments have the power to invest in waste management infrastructure and implement national recycling programs, which are essential for a circular economy. The success of plastic bag bans in countries like Rwanda and Kenya demonstrates the effectiveness of top-down legislative action.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that individual responsibility plays a crucial role in the fight against plastic pollution. The choices we make as consumers have a cumulative effect on the demand for plastic products. By consciously reducing our own plastic footprint – for example, by carrying reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups – we can send a powerful message to businesses that there is a growing market for sustainable products. Moreover, individual action can foster a sense of collective responsibility and inspire wider community engagement. Grassroots movements and educational campaigns, often driven by passionate individuals, have been instrumental in raising awareness and promoting behavioral change.

In my opinion, while both government intervention and individual action are important, they are two sides of the same coin and must work in tandem to be truly effective. Government bans can create the necessary regulatory framework and level the playing field for businesses, but they are unlikely to succeed without public buy-in and participation. Similarly, individual efforts can only go so far without the support of robust policies and infrastructure. Therefore, the most effective solution is a multi-faceted approach that combines strong government leadership with widespread public engagement. This could include a combination of bans on certain products, investment in recycling technology, and public awareness campaigns to encourage more sustainable lifestyles.

In conclusion, the problem of plastic pollution is too complex to be solved by a single solution. While both government bans and individual responsibility have their merits, a collaborative approach that integrates both top-down and bottom-up strategies is ultimately the most promising path towards a plastic-free future.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I’d like to talk about a time when I made a conscious effort to reduce my plastic consumption. This was about a year ago, after I watched a documentary about the impact of plastic pollution on marine life. I was really shocked by the images of turtles and seabirds entangled in plastic waste, and I decided that I had to do something to change my own habits.

So, I started by doing a “plastic audit” of my home. I went through my kitchen, bathroom, and cleaning supplies, and I was amazed at how much single-use plastic I was using. Everything from food packaging and toiletries to cleaning products came in a plastic container. I decided to start small and focus on a few key areas. The first thing I did was to stop buying bottled water and start carrying a reusable water bottle with me everywhere I went. I also invested in a set of reusable shopping bags and produce bags, so I could avoid using plastic bags at the supermarket.

I did this because I felt a sense of personal responsibility to do my part to protect the environment. The documentary had really opened my eyes to the scale of the problem, and I couldn’t just sit back and do nothing. I also wanted to set a good example for my friends and family.

At first, it was a bit of a challenge to remember to bring my reusable items with me, but it soon became a habit. I felt really good about the changes I was making, and it was satisfying to see how much plastic I was able to avoid using. It also made me more mindful of my consumption in general, and I started to look for other ways to live more sustainably. It was a small change, but it made me feel empowered and hopeful that I could make a difference.
