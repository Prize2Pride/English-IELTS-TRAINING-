### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The History of Vaccination**

The concept of intentionally exposing individuals to a less severe form of a disease to build immunity has roots stretching back centuries. As early as the 15th century, and possibly even earlier, a practice known as variolation was employed in various parts of the world to combat smallpox. This method involved inoculating healthy individuals with material from smallpox sores, a risky procedure that nonetheless represented one of the earliest attempts at immunization. A significant milestone in the history of vaccination occurred in 1721 when Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, having observed the practice in the Ottoman Empire, introduced smallpox inoculation to Europe. This set the stage for one of the most pivotal breakthroughs in medical history.

In 1796, English physician Edward Jenner revolutionized the field with his pioneering work. Building on the observation that milkmaids who contracted cowpox, a milder disease, seemed to be immune to smallpox, Jenner conducted a groundbreaking experiment. He inoculated an eight-year-old boy, James Phipps, with material from a cowpox sore. After a brief period of mild illness, Phipps made a full recovery. Two months later, Jenner exposed Phipps to smallpox, and the boy remained healthy, demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccination. The term "vaccine" itself is derived from "vacca," the Latin word for cow, a testament to the origins of this life-saving innovation.

The 19th century witnessed further advancements, most notably through the work of Louis Pasteur. In 1885, Pasteur developed a vaccine for rabies, a fatal disease. His method involved a series of injections with progressively stronger doses of the rabies virus, a controversial but ultimately successful approach. This period also saw the development of antitoxins for diseases like diphtheria, thanks to the work of scientists like Dr. Anna Wessels Williams.

The 20th century ushered in an era of rapid vaccine development. The devastating Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 spurred research into an influenza vaccine. The mid-20th century saw the development of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk, followed by an oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin. These vaccines were instrumental in the near-eradication of polio. The latter half of the century saw the introduction of combination vaccines like the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, and the establishment of global immunization programs like the World Health Organization's (WHO) Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).

The culmination of these global efforts was the eradication of smallpox, declared by the WHO in 1980. This monumental achievement stands as a testament to the power of vaccination. The late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen the development of vaccines for a wide range of diseases, including hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), and rotavirus. The recent COVID-19 pandemic witnessed the unprecedentedly rapid development and deployment of new vaccine technologies, including mRNA vaccines.

Despite these remarkable successes, challenges remain. Vaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation, poses a significant threat to public health. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines for all populations, particularly in low-income countries, is another critical challenge. The history of vaccination is a story of scientific ingenuity, perseverance, and global collaboration, a story that continues to unfold as we confront new and existing infectious diseases.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**How Vaccines Work: A Symphony of the Immune System**

**A.** Vaccines are one of the most remarkable achievements of modern medicine, a testament to our growing understanding of the intricate workings of the human immune system. At its core, a vaccine works by safely introducing a component of a pathogen, or a weakened or inactivated form of the pathogen itself, to the body. This "training exercise" allows the immune system to develop a defense against the real pathogen without having to experience the full-blown illness.

**B.** The key players in this defense are white blood cells, the soldiers of the immune system. When a vaccine is administered, it triggers an immune response. Specialized white blood cells called B-lymphocytes produce antibodies, which are proteins that are custom-designed to recognize and bind to specific antigens – the foreign substances on the surface of the pathogen. These antibodies act like tags, marking the invaders for destruction by other immune cells.

**C.** But the immune system's response doesn't stop there. Another type of white blood cell, the T-lymphocyte, is also activated. There are two main types of T-lymphocytes involved in this process: helper T-cells and killer T-cells. Helper T-cells orchestrate the immune response, stimulating B-lymphocytes to produce antibodies and activating killer T-cells. Killer T-cells, as their name suggests, directly attack and destroy infected cells, preventing the pathogen from replicating and spreading.

**D.** The true genius of vaccination lies in the creation of immunological memory. After the initial "infection" from the vaccine has been cleared, a small number of memory B-lymphocytes and memory T-lymphocytes remain in the body. These long-lived cells "remember" the specific antigen they encountered. If the body is later exposed to the actual pathogen, these memory cells can quickly mount a robust and targeted immune response, producing a flood of antibodies and activating a large number of killer T-cells to neutralize the threat before it can cause disease.

**E.** There are several different types of vaccines, each with its own mechanism of action. Live-attenuated vaccines, such as the MMR vaccine, contain a weakened form of the live virus. These vaccines produce a very strong and long-lasting immune response that is similar to that of a natural infection. Inactivated vaccines, such as the seasonal flu shot, contain a killed version of the pathogen. These vaccines are generally safer for people with weakened immune systems but may require multiple doses or booster shots to maintain immunity.

**F.** Other types of vaccines include subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines, which use only specific pieces of the pathogen, such as its protein, sugar, or capsid (a casing around the germ). Toxoid vaccines, like the tetanus shot, contain a toxin made by the germ that has been made harmless. More recently, mRNA vaccines, like some of the COVID-19 vaccines, have been developed. These vaccines use a new approach that teaches our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Future of Vaccination: Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Innovation**

Vaccination stands as a cornerstone of public health, a testament to human ingenuity in the face of infectious diseases. The eradication of smallpox and the near-elimination of polio are monumental achievements that underscore the transformative power of vaccines. However, the journey of vaccination is far from over. The 21st century presents a new set of challenges and opportunities, demanding innovative approaches to vaccine development and global immunization strategies.

One of the most significant hurdles in the modern era is the rise of vaccine hesitancy. Fueled by misinformation and disinformation spread through social media and other channels, a growing number of individuals are questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccines. This has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles in some parts of the world. Addressing vaccine hesitancy requires a multi-pronged approach, including transparent communication from public health officials, community engagement, and education to build trust and counter false narratives.

Another major challenge is the threat of emerging infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder of the speed at which new pathogens can emerge and spread globally. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines was a remarkable scientific achievement, but it also highlighted the need for a more proactive and prepared approach to future pandemics. This includes investing in research and development for "platform technologies" that can be quickly adapted to create vaccines for new pathogens, as well as strengthening global surveillance systems to detect and respond to outbreaks early.

Furthermore, there are still many diseases for which we do not have effective vaccines. These "difficult" pathogens, such as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, present complex scientific challenges. They have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade the human immune system, making it difficult to design vaccines that can induce a protective and long-lasting immune response. Overcoming these challenges will require a deeper understanding of the immunology of these diseases and the development of novel vaccine technologies.

The future of vaccination will also be shaped by advancements in our understanding of the human immune system. The field of "systems vaccinology" aims to take a holistic view of the immune response to vaccination, using advanced technologies to analyze the complex interplay of genes, proteins, and cells. This approach could lead to the development of more personalized vaccines, tailored to an individual's age, genetics, and health status. For example, we may be able to develop more effective vaccines for the elderly, whose immune systems tend to weaken with age.

Moreover, new vaccine delivery systems are being explored. Needle-free methods, such as microneedle patches or oral vaccines, could make vaccination less painful and easier to administer, particularly in resource-limited settings. These innovations could help to improve vaccine coverage and reach populations that are currently underserved.

In conclusion, while the successes of vaccination are undeniable, the path forward requires a concerted effort to address the challenges of vaccine hesitancy, emerging diseases, and difficult pathogens. By embracing innovation in vaccine technology, strengthening global collaboration, and building public trust, we can continue to harness the power of vaccination to protect and improve the health of people worldwide.

**Sarah:** Okay, thank you very much.

**Receptionist:** You're welcome. We'll see you on the 5th.

**SECTION 2**

**Presenter:** Good evening, everyone, and thank you for coming to this community information session. My name is David, and I'm the public health coordinator for our town. Tonight, I want to talk to you about our annual 'Community Shield' program, which is all about keeping our community healthy during the winter months. The primary goal of the program is to **(11) increase vaccination rates for the seasonal flu**. While we always encourage general wellness, this program is specifically focused on flu prevention.

This year, our main information session, which is this one, is being held here at the **(12) Town Hall**. We find it's the most central location for everyone. We have a number of other events and clinics planned across the town, which I'll detail in a moment.

In the past, we've often focused our campaigns on specific groups, like the elderly or young children. However, this year, our message is that the flu can affect anyone, so we are encouraging **(13) all community members** to get vaccinated. It's about protecting yourself and creating a 'shield' of immunity around those who are more vulnerable.

We're always looking for ways to make it easier for people to get their vaccinations. This year, we're very excited to introduce a **(14) mobile vaccination clinic**. This bus will travel to different neighborhoods, especially those with fewer transport links, making it more convenient than ever. We're also continuing our online booking system, which was very popular last year.

Finally, before I move on, I want to stress the importance of community-mindedness. Getting vaccinated isn't just about your own health. When you protect yourself, you also help protect your family, your friends, and the **(15) entire community**, especially those who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons. It's a small act that has a big impact.

Now, I'd like to give you some details about our vaccination locations over the next month. You can find all this information in the leaflet in front of you.

First, the **(16) Town Hall** will serve as our main information point. You can come here any weekday from 9 AM to 5 PM to ask questions and pick up leaflets, but please note that no vaccinations will be given here. So, this is the **(C) main information point**.

Next, we will have a clinic set up in the **(17) Central Shopping Centre**. This is always a popular location. To manage the numbers, this clinic will be **(B) requires an appointment**. You can book online or by phone. It will be open every day for the next two weeks.

Our **(18) Eastside Clinic** will be open from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays. This location will have the **(D) longest hours** to accommodate people who work late. We hope this will be convenient for many of you.

For families, we recommend visiting our clinic at **(19) Northwood Park** on the weekend. This location will have **(F) extra staff available**, including nurses who specialize in pediatric care, to make the experience as smooth as possible for children and parents. This clinic will be open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 AM to 4 PM.

Finally, the **(20) Community Library** will host our new mobile vaccination clinic on the first and third Mondays of the month. This location is ideal for **(E) people with mobility issues** as it is fully accessible and on a major bus route. No appointment is needed for the mobile clinic.

We hope you'll take advantage of one of these options. Thank you.

**SECTION 3**

**Chloe:** So, Liam, how are you feeling about our presentation on Tuesday? I've been going over my notes.

**Liam:** I'm a bit nervous, but I think we have some good material. I was just reading about the challenges in vaccine development. It's more complex than I thought.

**Chloe:** I know. So, we're focusing on **(21) the challenges in modern vaccine development**, right? Not the history or the distribution side of things.

**Liam:** Right. I was really surprised by the timelines. I didn't realize that from the initial research to getting a vaccine approved, it can take **(22) 10 to 15 years**. It's such a long process.

**Chloe:** Exactly. And that's for a relatively straightforward pathogen. It's even harder for viruses that change all the time. I was reading about the difficulties in creating a vaccine for HIV. The main issue is that the virus **(23) mutates so rapidly**. The immune system can't keep up, and it makes it incredibly hard to design a vaccine that provides lasting protection.

**Liam:** That makes sense. And then there's the clinical trial process itself. It's so rigorous. You have the preclinical stage, then Phase 1 with a small group of volunteers, then Phase 2 with a few hundred, and finally Phase 3 with thousands. It's a **(24) very long and complex process**, but it has to be, to ensure the vaccine is safe and effective.

**Chloe:** For sure. And even after all that, there's no guarantee of success. I read that a major hurdle, even for promising vaccines, is **(25) manufacturing on a large scale**. It's one thing to make a few thousand doses in a lab, but producing millions or billions of doses that are all consistent and sterile is a huge logistical challenge.

**Liam:** That's a good point. We should definitely include that. And what about public perception? I think that's a critical factor too.

**Chloe:** Absolutely. No matter how good a vaccine is, it won't work if people don't take it. So, **(26) public trust and acceptance** is essential. We've seen that with the measles outbreaks in recent years.

**Liam:** I was also looking at future technologies. I found an article about vaccine delivery systems. They're developing a patch with tiny microneedles that you just press onto your skin. It's painless and doesn't require a trained professional to administer. So, in the future, vaccines might be **(27) delivered through a patch**.

**Chloe:** Wow, that's amazing. I've been reading about the search for universal vaccines. For example, a universal flu vaccine that would protect against all strains and you'd only need to get it once, or maybe every ten years. I'm really interested in the development of **(28) universal vaccines**.

**Liam:** That would be a game-changer. Okay, so I think we have plenty of content. We just need to structure it. I've made a start on the slides, but I think our **(29) conclusion** is a bit weak. We just sort of stop.

**Chloe:** I agree. We need a strong final message. How about we end with a summary of the main challenges and then a look forward to these future technologies? We could **(30) create a clear summary slide** that brings it all together.

**Liam:** Perfect. Let's work on that now.

**SECTION 4**

**Lecturer:** Good morning. In today's lecture, we're going to discuss the global impact of vaccination, which is arguably one of the most significant public health achievements in human history. Vaccination programs have led to the control and, in some cases, the near-elimination of diseases that were once a major cause of death and disability.

Let's start with a couple of the most prominent historical success stories. The first, and most famous, is smallpox. For centuries, smallpox was a devastating disease. However, after a massive global vaccination campaign led by the World Health Organization, it was officially declared **(31) eradicated** in 1980. This is the only human disease to have been completely wiped out. Another incredible success story is polio. While not yet eradicated, we are very close. The Global Polio Eradication **(32) Initiative**, launched in 1988, has reduced cases by over 99%. A truly remarkable feat.

Beyond just preventing disease, vaccination has a profound economic and social impact. It dramatically reduces healthcare costs. It's far cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it. It also prevents the long-term disability that can result from illnesses like polio or measles. This, in turn, increases **(33) productivity**, as it keeps adults healthy and able to work. For children, it means they are healthy enough to attend school, which has a huge impact on their education and future opportunities.

Now, a key concept in vaccination is 'herd immunity'. This is when a large enough portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, making its spread from person to person unlikely. This is critical for protecting **(34) vulnerable** populations – this includes infants who are too young to be vaccinated, and people with compromised immune systems who cannot receive certain vaccines. The percentage of people who need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity varies, but for a highly contagious disease like measles, it's around 95%.

However, achieving high vaccination rates globally is not without its challenges. One of the biggest is **(35) equity**. There is a significant gap in access to vaccines between high-income and low-income countries. Another major challenge is infrastructure. Many vaccines require a reliable "**(36) cold chain**" – a system of storing and transporting vaccines at consistently low temperatures. This can be very difficult to maintain in some parts of the world. We also face the challenge of misinformation, which can undermine public trust and lead to a decline in vaccination rates. And finally, geography plays a role. Reaching people in **(37) remote** areas, or in regions affected by conflict, can be incredibly difficult.

Several global organizations are working to address these challenges. The WHO and UNICEF are, of course, key players. Another important organization is Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Gavi is a **(38) partnership** between public and private sectors, and it has played a huge role in providing affordable vaccines to the world's poorest countries.

Looking to the future, there is much to be optimistic about. Scientists are working on new vaccines for diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. And new delivery methods, such as the microneedle patches I mentioned, could significantly improve **(39) coverage** by making administration easier. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we cannot be complacent. We need continued investment in research and development, and strong **(40) collaboration** between countries to be prepared for future health crises. Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the changes in global vaccination coverage for four key childhood diseases—DTP, Measles, Polio, and Hepatitis B—between the years 2019 and 2021.

Overall, the data reveals a slight but consistent decrease in vaccination rates across all four diseases over the two-year period. In both years, the coverage for DTP, Polio, and Hepatitis B was significantly higher than for the second dose of the measles vaccine.

In 2019, the vaccination coverage for the third dose of DTP was 86%, which was the highest rate among the four diseases. The rates for the third dose of Polio and Hepatitis B were just slightly lower, at 85% each. However, by 2021, the coverage for DTP had fallen by five percentage points to 81%, and both Polio and Hepatitis B saw a similar drop to 80%. This indicates a worrying trend in the reach of these fundamental childhood immunization programs.

The coverage for the second dose of the measles vaccine was considerably lower than the other three in both years. In 2019, it stood at 71%, and this figure decreased to 69% in 2021. This two-percentage-point drop, while smaller in absolute terms, is significant given the already lower coverage rate for this important vaccine.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9)

The issue of mandatory vaccination is a complex and often contentious topic, balancing the principles of public health against individual autonomy. While some argue that compulsory vaccination is a necessary measure to protect the community, others vehemently defend the right of individuals to make their own medical choices. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

On one hand, the argument for mandatory vaccination is primarily rooted in the concept of herd immunity and the collective responsibility to protect public health. Proponents of this view contend that high vaccination rates are essential to create a protective shield for the entire population, particularly for the most vulnerable members of society who cannot be vaccinated due to age or medical conditions. The eradication of smallpox and the near-elimination of polio stand as powerful testaments to the success of widespread immunization programs. From this perspective, choosing not to vaccinate is not merely a personal decision but one that can have serious consequences for the community at large, potentially leading to the resurgence of preventable diseases. Therefore, governments have a legitimate role in mandating vaccinations as a critical public health intervention.

On the other hand, opponents of mandatory vaccination emphasize the importance of individual liberty and bodily autonomy. They argue that every person has the right to make informed decisions about their own healthcare, and that this right should not be infringed upon by the state. This viewpoint is often supported by concerns about the potential side effects of vaccines, as well as a general distrust of pharmaceutical companies and government institutions. For these individuals, the decision to vaccinate should be a matter of personal choice, based on their own beliefs, values, and assessment of the risks and benefits. Forcing individuals to undergo a medical procedure against their will is seen as a violation of fundamental human rights.

In my opinion, while the principle of individual choice is important, it should not outweigh the collective responsibility to protect public health, especially when it comes to highly infectious and dangerous diseases. The benefits of vaccination, both for the individual and for society, are overwhelmingly supported by scientific evidence. Therefore, I believe that governments are justified in mandating vaccinations for certain diseases, particularly for attendance at public schools and for employment in high-risk sectors like healthcare. However, such policies must be implemented with transparency, providing clear information and education to the public, and should include medical exemptions where appropriate. The goal should be to maximize public health protection while respecting individual rights to the greatest extent possible.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I’d like to talk about the time I received my COVID-19 vaccination. This was back in the spring of 2021, at a large vaccination centre that had been set up in a local exhibition hall. It was a very well-organized and impressive operation.

I needed this particular vaccination because, of course, we were in the midst of the global pandemic. The vaccine had been developed to protect against the virus, and it was being rolled out to the public. I was very keen to get it, not only to protect myself but also to do my part in helping to stop the spread of the virus and protect my family and the wider community. It felt like a really important step towards getting back to some sense of normality.

Before the injection, I have to admit I was a little bit nervous. It wasn’t about the needle itself, but more about the fact that this was a new vaccine and there was so much discussion and debate about it in the media. However, the staff at the vaccination centre were incredibly professional and reassuring. They answered all my questions and made me feel at ease. The injection itself was very quick and almost painless. Afterwards, I had to wait for about 15 minutes to make sure I didn’t have any immediate reaction. My arm was a bit sore for a day or two, and I felt a little tired, but that was it.

The overall experience was very positive. It felt like I was part of a huge, collective effort. There was a real sense of community and hope in the air. It was a very memorable and significant moment for me, and I was very grateful to all the scientists and healthcare workers who made it possible.
