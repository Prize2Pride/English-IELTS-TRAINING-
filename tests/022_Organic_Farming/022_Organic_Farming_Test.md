**The Origins and Principles of Organic Farming**

Organic farming, a method of crop and livestock production that involves much more than choosing not to use pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones, is a system that is holistic and sustainable. It is a production system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity. The philosophy behind organic farming is to work in harmony with nature, rather than against it. This involves using techniques to achieve good crop yields without harming the natural environment or the people who live and work in it.

The history of organic farming dates back to the early 20th century, a time of great change in the agricultural world. The development of artificial fertilizers in the mid-19th century, followed by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, led to a revolution in farming practices. These new technologies, while offering short-term benefits in terms of increased yields, had serious long-term consequences. Soil compaction, erosion, and a decline in overall soil fertility became widespread problems. Furthermore, concerns grew about the potential health risks of toxic chemicals entering the food supply.

In response to these challenges, pioneers of the organic movement began to explore alternative approaches to farming. Sir Albert Howard, a British botanist working in India in the early 1900s, is often referred to as the “father of organic farming.” He observed traditional Indian farming practices and was impressed by their sustainability. He developed a system of organic agriculture that integrated traditional methods with modern scientific knowledge. His work, particularly his book “An Agricultural Testament,” published in 1940, laid the foundations for the modern organic movement.

Another key figure in the history of organic farming was Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher who gave a series of lectures on agriculture in 1924. He introduced the concept of “biodynamic agriculture,” a holistic approach that views the farm as a living organism. Biodynamic farming emphasizes the importance of balancing the relationship between the soil, plants, and animals, and creating a self-sustaining system.

The term “organic farming” was first coined by Lord Northbourne in his 1940 book, “Look to the Land.” He defined it as a system where the farm is viewed as a complex, living entity. This holistic perspective remains a core principle of organic farming today. The movement gained further momentum through the work of individuals like J.I. Rodale in the United States, who founded the Rodale Institute to promote organic methods, and Lady Eve Balfour in the United Kingdom, who conducted the Haughley Experiment, the first scientific comparison of organic and conventional farming.

At its core, organic farming is guided by a set of principles that distinguish it from other agricultural systems. These principles, as defined by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), are health, ecology, fairness, and care. The principle of health emphasizes that organic agriculture should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plants, animals, humans, and the planet as one and indivisible. The principle of ecology is based on the idea that organic agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them. The principle of fairness highlights the importance of equity, respect, justice, and stewardship of the shared world, both among people and in their relationships with other living beings. Finally, the principle of care states that organic agriculture should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well-being of current and future generations and the environment.

**PASSAGE 2**

**The Multifaceted Benefits of Organic Agriculture**

**A.** Organic farming, a practice that has gained significant traction in recent years, offers a compelling array of benefits that extend beyond the farm gate. These advantages can be broadly categorized into three interconnected areas: environmental, health, and economic. By eschewing synthetic inputs and embracing ecological principles, organic agriculture presents a viable path towards a more sustainable and equitable food system. This passage will explore the multifaceted benefits of organic farming, delving into its positive impacts on the planet, human well-being, and the livelihoods of farmers.

**B.** From an environmental perspective, organic farming is a powerful tool for conservation and restoration. One of its most significant contributions is the improvement of soil health. Organic farmers utilize practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and the application of compost to build and maintain healthy soil. This, in turn, enhances water retention, reduces soil erosion, and promotes a vibrant community of beneficial microorganisms. Furthermore, by avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, organic farming protects water quality, preventing the contamination of rivers, lakes, and groundwater. The absence of these chemicals also fosters greater biodiversity, creating a haven for wildlife, including pollinators and natural predators of pests.

**C.** The health benefits of organic food are a primary driver for many consumers. While the nutritional differences between organic and conventionally grown food are still a subject of ongoing research, studies have consistently shown that organic produce contains lower levels of pesticide residues. This is a significant advantage, as exposure to pesticides has been linked to a range of health problems. Moreover, some studies suggest that organic foods may have higher concentrations of certain nutrients, such as antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. The prohibition of antibiotics and growth hormones in organic livestock farming also addresses public health concerns about the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

**D.** Beyond the direct health benefits of consuming organic food, the practice of organic farming also contributes to a healthier environment for farmworkers and rural communities. Farmworkers on conventional farms are at a high risk of exposure to toxic chemicals, which can lead to acute and chronic health issues. By eliminating the use of these substances, organic farming provides a safer working environment. The reduction in chemical runoff also means cleaner air and water for those living in agricultural areas, contributing to the overall well-being of rural populations.

**E.** The economic viability of organic farming is a critical factor in its long-term sustainability. While organic farming can be more labor-intensive and may have lower yields in some cases, organic farmers can often command premium prices for their products. This “organic premium” can offset the higher production costs and lead to increased profitability. Furthermore, organic farming can reduce input costs by eliminating the need for expensive synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. By building healthy soil, organic farmers can also improve the long-term productivity of their land, making their farms more resilient to drought and other environmental challenges.

**F.** The economic benefits of organic farming are not limited to individual farmers. The growth of the organic sector creates jobs in farming, processing, and retail. It also stimulates rural economies by promoting local food systems and creating new market opportunities. The demand for organic products is growing globally, providing a significant export market for many countries. By supporting organic agriculture, consumers can contribute to the development of a more resilient and prosperous food system that benefits both people and the planet.

**PASSAGE 3**

**The Hurdles and Complexities of Organic Farming**

While the benefits of organic farming are widely recognized, the transition to and practice of this agricultural system are not without their challenges. A host of obstacles, ranging from agronomic and economic to regulatory and market-related, can make organic farming a difficult path for many farmers. Understanding these hurdles is crucial for developing effective strategies to support the growth of the organic sector and make it a more accessible and viable option for producers worldwide.

One of the most significant challenges in organic farming is managing pests and weeds without the use of synthetic herbicides and pesticides. Organic farmers must rely on a diverse toolkit of alternative strategies, including crop rotation, intercropping, mechanical weeding, and the use of biological pest control agents. These methods can be more labor-intensive and may not always be as effective as their chemical counterparts, leading to potential yield losses. The risk of crop failure due to pest or disease outbreaks is a constant concern for organic farmers, particularly during the transition period when the farm’s ecosystem is still adapting to the new management practices.

Soil fertility management is another key challenge. Organic farmers are prohibited from using synthetic fertilizers and must instead rely on natural sources of nutrients, such as compost, manure, and green manures. Building and maintaining healthy, fertile soil is a long-term process that requires careful planning and management. In the short term, organic farmers may face challenges in providing their crops with sufficient nutrients, which can impact yields. The availability and cost of organic-approved fertilizers and soil amendments can also be a limiting factor for some farmers.

Economic considerations are a major hurdle for many farmers considering a switch to organic production. The transition period, which typically lasts for three years, can be particularly challenging. During this time, farmers must adhere to organic standards but cannot yet sell their products as certified organic. This means they may face higher production costs and lower yields without the benefit of the organic price premium. The cost of organic certification itself can also be a barrier for small-scale farmers. While the organic premium can lead to higher profitability in the long run, the initial investment and financial risks can be daunting.

Market access and infrastructure can also pose significant challenges for organic farmers. In some regions, the demand for organic products may be limited, or the infrastructure for processing, distributing, and marketing organic goods may be underdeveloped. This can make it difficult for farmers to find a reliable market for their products and receive a fair price. Furthermore, the risk of contamination from neighboring conventional farms, through pesticide drift or genetically modified pollen, is a constant threat to the integrity of organic crops and the certification status of organic farms.

Finally, the regulatory landscape of organic farming can be complex and difficult to navigate. Organic standards vary from country to country, and the certification process can be bureaucratic and time-consuming. Keeping up with changes in regulations and maintaining the necessary records can be a significant administrative burden for farmers. The lack of adequate research and extension services focused on organic farming in many regions can also make it difficult for farmers to access the information and support they need to succeed.

Despite these challenges, the organic sector continues to grow, driven by increasing consumer demand for healthy and sustainable food. By addressing the hurdles faced by organic farmers through research, policy, and market development, we can help to create a more resilient and sustainable food system for the future.

**Representative:** 07700 900123. Thank you. Now, let’s look at the subscription options. What kind of box were you interested in?

**Sarah:** I was looking at the **Mixed** Box, the one with both fruit and vegetables.

**Representative:** Excellent choice. And what size would you like? We have small, medium, and large.

**Sarah:** The medium should be fine. It’s for two or three people, right?

**Representative:** That’s right. And how often would you like to receive your box? We offer weekly or fortnightly deliveries.

**Sarah:** I think every **two weeks** would be best for us.

**Representative:** Okay. And when would you like your first delivery?

**Sarah:** Let’s see… Today is the 10th of March. Could I have the first one on the **24th of March**?

**Representative:** Yes, that’s fine. Now, are there any vegetables you particularly dislike? We can exclude them from your box.

**Sarah:** Oh, that’s great. I’m not a big fan of **cabbage**.

**Representative:** No cabbage. Noted. Any other special requests?

**Sarah:** Yes, could you make sure there are no **potatoes** in the box? We seem to have a lot of them at the moment.

**Representative:** No potatoes. I’ve made a note of that. Now, for payment. How would you like to pay?

**Sarah:** I’ll pay by **credit card**.

**Representative:** Okay. The total cost for the medium mixed box delivered every two weeks is **£25.50** per delivery. So, that’s £51 per month. Is that okay?

**Sarah:** Yes, that sounds fine.

**Representative:** Great. I’ll just take your card details…

**SECTION 2**

**(Sound of people chatting, birds singing)**

**Speaker:** Good morning everyone, and a very warm welcome to Greenwood Farm. My name is David, and I’m the farm manager. It’s great to see so many new faces here today. The main purpose of this introductory tour is to show you around the farm and explain how you can get involved as a volunteer. We’re a community-run project, which means the farm is managed by a cooperative of local residents, and we rely on the help of volunteers like you to keep things running smoothly.

First, I’ll give you a brief overview of the farm. We’re a 10-acre site, and we grow a wide variety of organic vegetables, fruits, and herbs. We also have a small flock of chickens for eggs. Our aim is to provide fresh, healthy, and affordable food for the local community, while also promoting sustainable farming practices. As a volunteer, you’ll have the opportunity to learn new skills, meet like-minded people, and, of course, you’ll get to take home a share of the harvest. We also offer a discount on our workshops for all our regular volunteers.

Now, let’s start our tour. If you look at the map I’ve given you, you’ll see the layout of the farm. We’re currently standing at the entrance, next to the farm shop. The first area we’re going to visit is the polytunnels. These are the large plastic tunnels over there. This is where we grow our salad crops and other vegetables that need a bit of extra protection from the weather. Your main task here will be **vegetable harvesting**, especially in the summer months.

Next, we’ll move on to the orchard. We have a variety of fruit trees here, including apples, pears, and plums. In the autumn, this is where we do all our **fruit picking**. It’s a really enjoyable task, and the views from the top of the orchard are amazing.

After the orchard, we’ll head to the community garden. This is a space where local residents can rent a small plot of land to grow their own food. As a volunteer, you might be asked to help with **weeding** or watering in this area.

From the community garden, we’ll make our way to the barn. This is where we store our tools and equipment, and it’s also where we run our workshops. This weekend, for example, we have a **workshop on soil health**. If you’re interested, you can sign up at the farm shop later.

Finally, we’ll end our tour at the wildlife pond. This is a really important part of the farm’s ecosystem, as it attracts a wide range of beneficial insects and other wildlife. We have a small beehive here, and you can often see our beekeeper at work. The main activity here is **beekeeping**, but we ask that you don’t get too close to the hives unless you’re with the beekeeper.

So, that’s a brief overview of the farm. Now, are there any questions before we start our walk?

**SECTION 3**

**(Sound of students chatting in a common room)**

**Chloe:** So, Mark, have you started thinking about our presentation on organic farming?

**Mark:** A little bit. I’ve been looking at the economic viability of it. It seems like a pretty complex issue.

**Chloe:** I know. I’ve been reading up on the environmental benefits. It’s fascinating how much of a positive impact it can have. The way conventional farming uses pesticides, for example, has a devastating effect on biodiversity.

**Mark:** I agree that the environmental side is important, but we also need to be realistic. The main problem with organic farming is that it can’t produce enough food to feed the world. The yields are often lower than conventional farming, and that’s a major concern.

**Chloe:** I’m not so sure about that. I’ve read some studies that suggest the yield gap between organic and conventional farming can be closed with the right techniques, like intercropping and crop rotation. It’s not a simple black and white issue.

**Mark:** Maybe, but those techniques are often more labor-intensive, which drives up the cost for consumers. And let’s be honest, not everyone can afford to pay a premium for organic food.

**Chloe:** That’s true, but I think we also need to consider the role of technology. There are some really interesting innovations in agritech that could help to improve the efficiency of organic systems and bring down the costs. Things like precision weeding and drone technology for pest control.

**Mark:** I’m a bit skeptical about the role of technology in organic farming. It seems to go against the whole philosophy of working in harmony with nature.

**Chloe:** I see your point, but I think we need to be open to new ideas. The key to the future of farming is a shift towards more sustainable practices, and that might mean combining the best of both worlds – the ecological principles of organic farming and the technological advancements of modern agriculture.

**Mark:** I suppose you’re right. It’s not about one system being better than the other, but about finding a balance.

**Chloe:** Exactly. So, for our presentation, we could discuss both the challenges and the opportunities of organic farming, and then propose a more integrated approach for the future.

**Mark:** That sounds like a good plan. I’m feeling more optimistic about it now.

**Chloe:** Me too. I think consumer awareness is also a crucial factor. The more people understand the true cost of cheap food, the more they’ll be willing to support sustainable alternatives.

**Mark:** And the government has a role to play too. They should provide more financial incentives for farmers to transition to organic methods.

**Chloe:** Absolutely. So, shall we start putting together a structure for our presentation?

**Mark:** Yes, let’s do it. I’ll start by creating a shared document and we can both add our ideas.

**Chloe:** Great. I’ll start by writing up my notes on the environmental benefits.

**Mark:** And I’ll focus on the economic aspects and the role of technology. This is going to be a great presentation.

**SECTION 4**

**(Sound of a university lecture)**

**Professor:** Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at the future of food, and specifically, the role of agroecology and organic farming in creating a more sustainable food system. As you know, the current industrial model of agriculture is having a significant negative impact on the **environment**. It’s a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and biodiversity loss. So, we urgently need to find a new way of feeding the world that is both productive and sustainable.

One of the most promising solutions is agroecology. Now, what do we mean by agroecology? Well, it’s a holistic approach to agriculture that views farms as **ecosystems**. It’s about designing farming systems that mimic natural processes, in order to build healthy soil, promote biodiversity, and minimize the need for external inputs. A key aspect of agroecology is the emphasis on **local knowledge** and the participation of farmers in the research and development process.

So, what are the key principles of agroecology? The first is recycling. This means that nutrients and resources are recycled within the farm system, rather than being imported from outside. For example, animal manure is used to fertilize the crops, and crop residues are used to feed the animals. The second principle is input reduction. This means minimizing the use of external inputs like synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, agroecological farmers rely on natural processes to maintain soil fertility and control pests. The third principle is soil health. Building and maintaining healthy soil is the cornerstone of agroecology. This is achieved through practices like cover cropping and **composting**. The fourth principle is animal welfare. Animals are integrated into the farming system in a humane and sustainable way. And the final principle is biodiversity. Agroecology promotes a diverse range of crops, animals, and wildlife, which makes the farming system more resilient to pests, diseases, and climate change.

Now, you might be wondering how agroecology relates to organic farming. Well, organic farming is a form of agroecology, but not all agroecological farms are **certified organic**. Agroecology is a broader concept that also includes social and **economic** dimensions. It’s about creating a food system that is not only environmentally sustainable, but also socially just and economically viable.

So, what are the benefits of agroecology? From an environmental perspective, it can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect water quality and **soil**, and enhance biodiversity. From a social perspective, it can empower farmers and local communities, and improve food security and **nutrition**. And from an economic perspective, it can reduce production costs and create new market opportunities.

Of course, there are also challenges. The main ones are a lack of policy support, research funding, and consumer awareness. To move forward, we need a **paradigm shift** in our food system. We need greater investment in agroecological research and education, and we need to build stronger connections between farmers and **consumers**. Only then can we create a food system that is truly sustainable and equitable for all.

Now, are there any questions?

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the development of organic farming in a specific European nation over a 30-year period, from 1995 to 2025. The data presented covers the number of registered organic farms and the corresponding total land area dedicated to organic cultivation.

Overall, the trend for both metrics is one of significant growth, indicating a substantial expansion of the organic farming sector in this country. The number of organic farms is projected to increase more than tenfold, while the area of organic land is expected to see an even more dramatic rise.

In 1995, there were just under 2,000 organic farms, cultivating a total of approximately 100,000 hectares of land. A decade later, in 2005, the number of farms had more than doubled to around 4,000, and the area of organic land had tripled to 300,000 hectares. This strong growth continued over the next ten years, with the number of farms reaching 8,000 and the land area expanding to 700,000 hectares in 2015.

Projections for 2025 suggest that this upward trend will continue, albeit at a slightly slower rate. The number of organic farms is expected to reach 12,000, while the total area of organic land is predicted to hit the 1 million hectare mark. This indicates a sustained and growing commitment to organic agriculture in the country.

### Model essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)

The debate surrounding organic food is a contentious one, with strong arguments on both sides. While some consumers view it as a marketing ploy designed to extract a premium from the health-conscious, others passionately advocate for its benefits to both human well-being and the environment. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding opinion.

On one hand, the skepticism towards organic food is not entirely unfounded. The term “organic” has become a powerful marketing tool, and the higher price tag associated with these products can be a significant barrier for many consumers. Critics argue that the nutritional benefits of organic food are often exaggerated and that conventional produce is perfectly safe and healthy when consumed as part of a balanced diet. They point to the lack of conclusive scientific evidence to support the claim that organic food is significantly more nutritious than its non-organic counterpart. Furthermore, the complex and often bureaucratic nature of organic certification can lead to suspicion and mistrust, with some questioning the integrity of the standards and the consistency of their enforcement.

On the other hand, the arguments in favour of organic food are compelling. Proponents emphasize the significant environmental benefits of organic farming, which prohibits the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. These chemicals have been shown to have a detrimental impact on soil health, water quality, and biodiversity. By supporting organic agriculture, consumers are investing in a more sustainable and ecologically sound food system. From a health perspective, the lower levels of pesticide residues in organic food are a key advantage, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women. While the nutritional debate may be ongoing, the avoidance of potentially harmful chemicals is a clear and tangible benefit.

In my opinion, while the marketing of organic food can sometimes be overzealous, the fundamental principles of organic agriculture are sound and offer a viable path towards a more sustainable future. The higher cost of organic food reflects the true cost of producing food in a way that does not harm the environment or human health. While it may not be a feasible option for everyone, the growing demand for organic products is a positive trend that is driving change in the agricultural industry. Ultimately, the choice to buy organic is a personal one, but it is a choice that has far-reaching implications for our planet and our collective well-being.

### Speaking Part 2 sample response

Last summer, I had the opportunity to visit a wonderful little farm called “Green Shoots,” which is located just outside my hometown. It’s a community-supported agriculture (CSA) farm, which means it’s a small-scale, independent farm that sells its produce directly to local residents through a subscription service.

I went there with a friend who is a subscriber, and we spent a lovely afternoon helping out with the harvest. We picked everything from ripe, juicy tomatoes to crisp, green lettuce. The farmer, a very friendly and knowledgeable man named Tom, showed us around the farm and explained the principles of organic farming. It was fascinating to see how he used natural methods to control pests and maintain the fertility of the soil.

What I enjoyed most about the visit was the feeling of being connected to the food I eat. It was so rewarding to see the vegetables growing in the fields and to know that they were being produced in a way that was good for the environment. The taste of the freshly picked tomatoes was incredible – so much better than anything you can buy in a supermarket. The whole experience gave me a much greater appreciation for the hard work and dedication of farmers, and it has inspired me to seek out more locally grown and organic food.
