## GRAMMAR SECTION
Modern slavery is a complex and multifaceted issue that often goes unnoticed in our globalized world. It is an umbrella term for a range of exploitative practices where individuals are unable to leave their situation due to threats, violence, coercion, deception, or an abuse of power. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that on any given day, there are around 50 million people trapped in modern slavery, with women and children being disproportionately affected. This global crime generates an estimated $236 billion in illegal profits each year, fueling a cycle of exploitation and poverty.

One of the most prevalent forms of modern slavery is **forced labour**, where individuals are compelled to work against their will under the threat of a penalty. This can occur in various industries, including agriculture, construction, domestic work, and manufacturing. Victims of forced labour are often subjected to long hours, low or no pay, and unsafe working conditions. They may have their passports or other identification documents confiscated, making it impossible for them to escape. The products of forced labour often end up in the supply chains of major corporations, meaning that consumers may unknowingly be contributing to this exploitation.

Another common form of modern slavery is **debt bondage**, also known as bonded labour. This occurs when a person is forced to work to pay off a debt. The debt may be inherited or incurred through a loan, and the terms of the debt are often so exploitative that it becomes impossible for the individual to repay it. The value of their work is often greater than the original loan, but they are trapped in a cycle of debt that can be passed down through generations. Debt bondage is particularly prevalent in South Asia, where it is deeply entrenched in traditional social hierarchies.

**Human trafficking** is another significant aspect of modern slavery. It involves the recruitment, transportation, and harbouring of individuals for the purpose of exploitation. This can include sexual exploitation, forced labour, and forced marriage. Traffickers often target vulnerable individuals, such as those living in poverty, those who have been displaced by conflict, or those who are seeking a better life. They may use deception, coercion, or violence to control their victims. Human trafficking is a global issue, with victims being trafficked within their own countries and across international borders.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the issue of modern slavery, and a number of international organizations and governments are working to combat it. However, the clandestine nature of this crime makes it difficult to tackle. The complex and often hidden nature of modern slavery requires a multi-faceted approach, involving law enforcement, businesses, civil society, and the general public. By raising awareness, strengthening laws, and holding perpetrators accountable, we can work towards a world free from slavery.

_**Passage 2**_

**The Far-Reaching Consequences of Modern Slavery and the Global Fight for Freedom**

**A.** The impact of modern slavery on its victims is profound and long-lasting. Individuals subjected to exploitation experience severe psychological trauma, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They are often stripped of their basic human rights and dignity, living in constant fear and isolation. Physical abuse is also rampant, with many victims suffering from injuries, malnutrition, and exhaustion. The loss of freedom and autonomy can have a devastating effect on a person's sense of self, making it incredibly difficult for them to reintegrate into society even after they have escaped their situation.

**B.** Beyond the individual suffering, modern slavery has far-reaching consequences for society as a whole. It undermines the rule of law, fuels corruption, and distorts economies. The illegal profits generated by modern slavery are often used to finance other criminal activities, creating a vicious cycle of crime and exploitation. Furthermore, businesses that use forced labour have an unfair advantage over legitimate businesses, leading to a race to the bottom in terms of wages and working conditions. This not only harms workers but also stifles economic development and innovation.

**C.** In our increasingly interconnected world, global supply chains have become a major conduit for modern slavery. From the clothes we wear to the food we eat, the products we consume may have been tainted by forced labour at some point in their journey from raw material to finished product. The complexity of these supply chains makes it difficult to trace the origins of goods and ensure that they have been produced ethically. While some corporations are taking steps to address this issue, many are still not doing enough to ensure that their supply chains are free from exploitation. This lack of transparency and accountability makes it all too easy for modern slavery to flourish.

**D.** In response to the global challenge of modern slavery, the international community has developed a number of legal frameworks and conventions. The United Nations has made the eradication of modern slavery a key priority, with Target 8.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals calling for an end to forced labour, modern slavery, and human trafficking by 2030. Other important international instruments include the Palermo Protocol, which provides a framework for the prevention, suppression, and punishment of trafficking in persons, and the ILO's Forced Labour Convention, which requires ratifying states to take measures to suppress the use of forced labour.

**E.** Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society play a crucial role in the fight against modern slavery. Organizations like Anti-Slavery International, Walk Free, and Free the Slaves work tirelessly to raise awareness, advocate for stronger laws, and provide direct support to victims. They conduct research, publish reports, and run campaigns to expose the reality of modern slavery and pressure governments and corporations to take action. They also provide essential services to survivors, such as shelter, legal assistance, and counseling, helping them to rebuild their lives.

**F.** Despite these efforts, the fight against modern slavery is far from over. The clandestine nature of the crime, the vast profits involved, and the vulnerability of its victims make it a formidable challenge. A multi-stakeholder approach is essential, involving governments, businesses, civil society, and consumers. Governments must enact and enforce strong laws, businesses must take responsibility for their supply chains, and consumers must demand ethically produced goods. By working together, we can create a world where everyone is free from the shackles of modern slavery.

_**Passage 3**_

In the ongoing struggle against modern slavery, two powerful forces have emerged as critical components of the solution: technology and individual action. While governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) continue to lead the charge, the innovative application of technology and the collective power of conscious individuals are proving to be indispensable in the quest to eradicate this global scourge. These elements are not a panacea, but they offer new tools and avenues for creating a more just and equitable world.

Technology, in its various forms, is being harnessed to shine a light on the darkest corners of exploitation. Advanced data analytics and satellite imagery are now used to identify and monitor potential sites of forced labour, such as remote agricultural plantations, illegal mining operations, and even fishing vessels at sea. Mobile applications have been developed to provide a secure and anonymous platform for individuals to report suspected cases of human trafficking and access vital information and support services. Furthermore, emerging technologies like blockchain are being explored as a means to enhance supply chain transparency, creating an immutable record of a product's journey from source to consumer and making it more difficult for forced labour to go undetected.

However, the use of technology in this context is not without its challenges. The so-called "digital divide" means that many of the world's most vulnerable populations lack access to the very technologies that could help protect them. There is also the ever-present risk that these same technologies could be co-opted by traffickers and exploiters for their own nefarious purposes, using the internet and social media to recruit and control their victims. Therefore, the deployment of technology must be accompanied by robust safeguards and a commitment to ensuring equitable access and digital literacy for all.

Alongside these technological advancements, the role of the individual has gained significant prominence. The concept of ethical consumerism, where individuals make purchasing decisions based on a company's social and environmental record, is putting pressure on businesses to clean up their supply chains. By choosing to support brands that are transparent about their production processes and committed to fair labour practices, consumers can send a powerful message that modern slavery is unacceptable. This collective purchasing power can be a potent driver of corporate responsibility and change.

Beyond their role as consumers, individuals can also act as advocates and agents of change. Supporting the campaigns of anti-slavery organizations, raising awareness within their own communities, and lobbying governments to enact and enforce stronger laws are all crucial actions. Volunteering time or donating to organizations that provide direct support to survivors of modern slavery can also make a tangible difference. Even a simple act, such as learning to recognize the signs of human trafficking and knowing how to report it, can be a lifesaver.

The fight against modern slavery is a complex and multifaceted challenge that no single entity can solve alone. While the efforts of governments and NGOs provide the essential framework for legal and structural change, the innovative application of technology and the conscious actions of individuals are vital complements. It is this combined, multi-stakeholder approach—one that integrates top-down policy with bottom-up, grassroots activism and technological innovation—that holds the greatest promise for finally breaking the chains of modern slavery and building a future where freedom is a reality for all.

_**Passage 1**_

Modern slavery is a complex and multifaceted issue that often goes unnoticed in our globalized world. It is an umbrella term for a range of exploitative practices where individuals are unable to leave their situation due to threats, violence, coercion, deception, or an abuse of power. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that on any given day, there are around 50 million people trapped in modern slavery, with women and children being disproportionately affected. This global crime generates an estimated $236 billion in illegal profits each year, fueling a cycle of exploitation and poverty.

One of the most prevalent forms of modern slavery is **forced labour**, where individuals are compelled to work against their will under the threat of a penalty. This can occur in various industries, including agriculture, construction, domestic work, and manufacturing. Victims of forced labour are often subjected to long hours, low or no pay, and unsafe working conditions. They may have their passports or other identification documents confiscated, making it impossible for them to escape. The products of forced labour often end up in the supply chains of major corporations, meaning that consumers may unknowingly be contributing to this exploitation.

Another common form of modern slavery is **debt bondage**, also known as bonded labour. This occurs when a person is forced to work to pay off a debt. The debt may be inherited or incurred through a loan, and the terms of the debt are often so exploitative that it becomes impossible for the individual to repay it. The value of their work is often greater than the original loan, but they are trapped in a cycle of debt that can be passed down through generations. Debt bondage is particularly prevalent in South Asia, where it is deeply entrenched in traditional social hierarchies.

**Human trafficking** is another significant aspect of modern slavery. It involves the recruitment, transportation, and harbouring of individuals for the purpose of exploitation. This can include sexual exploitation, forced labour, and forced marriage. Traffickers often target vulnerable individuals, such as those living in poverty, those who have been displaced by conflict, or those who are seeking a better life. They may use deception, coercion, or violence to control their victims. Human trafficking is a global issue, with victims being trafficked within their own countries and across international borders.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the issue of modern slavery, and a number of international organizations and governments are working to combat it. However, the clandestine nature of this crime makes it difficult to tackle. The complex and often hidden nature of modern slavery requires a multi-faceted approach, involving law enforcement, businesses, civil society, and the general public. By raising awareness, strengthening laws, and holding perpetrators accountable, we can work towards a world free from slavery.

## LISTENING SCRIPTS

**SECTION 1**

**(Sound of a phone ringing)**

**Operator:** Hello, you're through to the Modern Slavery Helpline. How can I help you?

**Sarah:** Hello. My name is Sarah Jones. I’m calling because I’m concerned about a car wash near my house. I think the workers there might be victims of forced labour.

**Operator:** Okay, thank you for calling, Sarah. I’ll just take a few details. Can you confirm the date for me? It’s the 18th of **January**?

**Sarah:** Yes, that’s right.

**Operator:** And you suspect it’s a case of forced labour. Can you tell me the location of the car wash?

**Sarah:** Yes, it’s called Sparkle Car Wash. It’s on **Newport** Road. That’s N-E-W-P-O-R-T.

**Operator:** Newport Road. Got it. Do you have a street number?

**Sarah:** Yes, it’s number 17.

**Operator:** And the postcode?

**Sarah:** I think it’s NW8 4JQ. Let me just double-check… Yes, NW8 **4JQ**.

**Operator:** Great. Now, can you tell me a bit more about why you’re concerned? What have you observed?

**Sarah:** Well, there are about five or six men working there. I’d say around **five** most days. They just look so exhausted and… well, **frightened**. They never seem to smile or talk to each other.

**Operator:** I see. And what about their working hours?

**Sarah:** They seem to be there all the time. I see them when I leave for work in the morning, and they’re still there when I get back late at night. I’m pretty sure they work seven days a week. I’ve never seen the place closed.

**Operator:** Seven days a week, you say? And do you know where they live?

**Sarah:** I think they live in the small house right next to the car wash. I’ve seen them all filing in there at the end of the day. It looks far too small for that many people.

**Operator:** Okay. Have you noticed anything else that’s made you suspicious?

**Sarah:** Yes, a couple of days ago, I saw the manager shouting at one of the workers. The worker looked terrified. Then the manager snatched the man’s **phone** out of his hand and put it in his own pocket.

**Operator:** That’s a very significant detail, Sarah. Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you’ve told me, we will certainly take action. What we’ll do is report this to the **police** for an initial investigation. We’ll also send you an information pack so you know what to expect.

**Sarah:** Oh, thank you. That’s good to know.

**Operator:** Can I take an email address to send that to you?

**Sarah:** Yes, it’s sarah.jones@**example**.com.

**Operator:** Perfect. I’ve just filed the report. Your reference number for this case is **MSH7891**.

**Sarah:** MSH7891. Got it. Thank you so much for your help.

**Operator:** You’re welcome, Sarah. Thank you for your call. Goodbye.

**SECTION 2**

**(Sound of applause)**

**David:** Good evening, everyone. Thank you for coming. My name is David, and I’m a community outreach coordinator for ‘Hope for Freedom’, a **non-governmental organization** dedicated to ending modern slavery right here in our community. I’m here tonight not to ask for money, but to open your eyes to a crime that is happening all around us, often in plain sight. My goal is simply to **raise awareness about modern slavery in the local area**, because awareness is the first step towards action.

Now, when you hear the term ‘modern slavery’, you might think of something happening in a faraway country. But the reality is, it’s happening right here, in our towns and cities. In our region, we’ve found that forced labour is particularly rampant in the **agricultural and food processing industries**. The seasonal nature of the work and the high demand for cheap labour create a perfect storm for exploitation.

Traffickers are cunning. They don’t use physical chains, but psychological ones. One of their most effective tactics is to create a sense of complete dependency. They do this by **isolating them from the outside world** – taking away their phones, their documents, and ensuring they can’t speak the local language. This creates a prison without bars.

So, what can you do? It’s a question I get asked all the time. The most crucial thing to remember is that your personal safety is paramount. If you suspect someone is a victim, please, do not intervene directly. The situation could be dangerous. The single most important first step you can take is **reporting your suspicions to the authorities or a dedicated helpline**, like the one you heard about earlier. They are trained to handle these situations safely and effectively.

Now, I want to give you some specific advice for different scenarios. Let’s say you see someone who appears very distressed, perhaps they look fearful or confused. What should you do? In this case, while your instinct might be to approach them, it’s safer not to. The best course of action is to **call the police immediately**. Let the professionals assess the situation.

What if you witness something more specific, like a person’s documents or passport being taken from them? This is a huge red flag. Again, do not get involved directly. Your priority should be to gather information that can help an investigation. If it’s safe to do so, **take a photograph as evidence**. This could be vital.

Another scenario: you see a group of people being transported in a way that seems unsafe or unusual – perhaps in the back of a van at odd hours. This could be a sign of trafficking. In this situation, try to **note down the vehicle registration number**. This piece of information can be incredibly helpful for the police in tracking the traffickers.

Perhaps your concern is about a local business. You’re worried about the working conditions at a nail bar, a restaurant, or a car wash. You’ve noticed the staff seem to work excessively long hours and look exhausted. Here, it’s about building a picture for the authorities. **Record the time and date of your observation**. Keep a log. A pattern of activity is much stronger evidence than a single observation.

Finally, what if you suspect a neighbor is a victim of domestic servitude? This is incredibly sensitive. They might be a nanny or a cleaner who never leaves the house and seems to be under the control of the family. In this instance, direct intervention is absolutely not advised. The best thing you can do is **report your concerns to a modern slavery helpline**. They can provide expert advice and take the appropriate steps.

Remember, you are our eyes and ears. By being vigilant and knowing how to respond, you can be a lifeline for someone trapped in slavery. Thank you.

**(Sound of applause)**

**SECTION 3**

**Dr. Evans:** Hi Chloe, Marcus. Come in. So, you’re going to talk me through your presentation proposal on modern slavery. Which specific area have you decided to focus on?

**Chloe:** Hi Dr. Evans. We’ve decided to look at **the role of corporations in preventing modern slavery**. We felt it was a really concrete area where change is possible.

**Marcus:** Yes, we wanted to move beyond just defining the problem and look at the solutions. But it’s proving to be more complex than we thought.

**Chloe:** My initial argument was that **supply chain transparency is the most critical factor**. If companies are forced to be open about every stage of their production, from the raw materials to the shop floor, then it’s much harder for slavery to hide. If consumers know where their products come from, they can make ethical choices.

**Marcus:** I agree transparency is key, but I’m a bit cynical. I’m concerned that many of these corporate social responsibility reports are just **used as a marketing tool**. A company publishes a glossy report saying all the right things, but on the ground, nothing really changes. It’s more about public relations than genuine accountability.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a very valid point, Marcus. And it’s a criticism that is often levelled at corporate self-regulation. You’re right to be skeptical. For many of these huge multinational corporations, a key challenge is simply **the complexity of their global supply chains**. We’re talking about networks that span dozens of countries, with multiple tiers of suppliers and sub-contractors. Tracking every single component is a monumental task.

**Chloe:** But it’s not impossible. I read about a sportswear brand that has made huge progress. It’s an example of a positive corporate initiative. This company has invested heavily in technology to do just that. It has **mapped its entire supply chain**, right down to the farms where the cotton is grown. They use GPS tracking and independent audits. It shows it can be done if the will is there.

**Marcus:** That’s a great example, Chloe. But that’s one company. What about the thousands that don’t have that commitment? That’s why I think we need more than just voluntary initiatives. I believe strong government regulation is essential because, frankly, **corporations cannot be trusted to regulate themselves**. It’s too easy to prioritize profit over people.

**Dr. Evans:** You’re touching on a central debate in this field, Marcus. The balance between voluntary codes of conduct and legally binding regulation. We can look at the **UK Modern Slavery Act as an example of** a legislative approach. It’s significant because it **requires companies to report on their anti-slavery efforts**. It forces them to publicly state what they are doing to tackle slavery in their supply chains.

**Chloe:** I agree it’s a good step, but I think its main limitation is that it **focuses on reporting rather than on taking action**. A company can comply with the law by simply stating that it has taken no steps. There are no real penalties for inaction. So, while it raises awareness, it doesn’t necessarily drive meaningful change.

**Marcus:** Exactly. So, we have voluntary corporate action, which can be effective but is often just for show, and we have legislation, which can be weak and lack teeth. It seems like neither is a perfect solution on its own.

**Dr. Evans:** And that brings you to a very strong conclusion. The most powerful approach is not one or the other, but **a combination of corporate, government, and consumer action**. When businesses, lawmakers, and the public all work together, that’s when you create real pressure for change.

**Chloe:** That makes sense. So for our presentation, we could analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both corporate and government approaches, and then argue for a more integrated model.

**Marcus:** I like that. We could use your sportswear company as a positive case study. So, we could present **a case study of a specific company’s supply chain** to illustrate what’s possible, and then contrast that with the legislative gaps.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. That sounds like a well-focused and critical presentation. I look forward to seeing it.

**SECTION 4**

**(Sound of a university lecture hall)**

**Professor:** Good morning. In our last lecture, we examined the economic drivers of modern slavery. Today, I want to shift our focus to the psychology of exploitation. If we can understand the psychological **mechanisms** that traffickers use to control their victims, we are in a much better position to develop effective prevention strategies and, crucially, to design support systems for survivors.

So, how does it begin? It rarely starts with overt violence. Instead, it begins with a process of grooming. Traffickers are adept at identifying and targeting individuals with specific **vulnerabilities**. This could be economic hardship, a lack of educational or employment opportunities, emotional distress following a family breakdown, or social **isolation**.

Once a target is identified, the trafficker will often build a relationship with them. The initial approach is almost always deceptive and friendly. It might be a false promise of a well-paid job in another country, an opportunity for education, or even a romantic **relationship**. This initial phase is all about creating a sense of hope and, most importantly, trust. The victim believes they have found a benefactor, someone who is helping them to a better life.

Once the victim is under the trafficker’s control, the methods shift from seduction to coercion. **Isolation** is a key tactic. Victims are systematically cut off from their families, friends, and any form of social support. Their phones might be confiscated, their movements restricted. This increases their **dependence** on the trafficker, who becomes their only point of contact with the world.

This isolation is then reinforced by coercion and intimidation. This can involve explicit threats of violence against the victim, or, often more effectively, against their **family** back home. The fear for their loved ones can be a more powerful chain than any physical restraint. And, of course, physical and sexual violence are tragically common, used to assert dominance and break the victim’s will.

But perhaps the most insidious form of control is psychological manipulation. Traffickers are masters of it. They might create a situation known as ‘trauma bonding’, where the victim, in a bizarre twist of survival psychology, develops a strange sense of **attachment** to their abuser. The trafficker might alternate between cruelty and small acts of kindness, which can create a powerful, confusing bond.

Another common tactic is ‘gaslighting’ – a form of manipulation where the abuser makes the victim doubt their own perceptions and sanity. They might deny that abusive events ever happened, or twist the facts to make the victim feel they are to blame for the abuse. Over time, this can completely erode a person’s sense of reality and self-worth, making them question their own **memory**.

Finally, this is all underpinned by economic abuse. Any wages the victim earns are often confiscated. They are told they have to pay off a huge, ever-increasing debt for their transport, food, and accommodation. This debt is a powerful tool of **control**, making the victim feel that they can never be free, that they are legally and morally bound to their exploiter.

Understanding these psychological tactics is not just an academic exercise. It’s fundamental to our response. Survivors of modern slavery are not just people who have been deprived of their freedom; they are people who have endured profound psychological trauma. They require long-term, specialized support to rebuild their lives. And for us, as a society, recognizing these subtle, insidious tactics is the first step in **disrupting** the cycle of exploitation before it can even begin. Now, let’s look at some case studies…

## TUTOR GUIDE

**WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER**

The bar chart illustrates the estimated number of individuals in modern slavery across five global regions in 2021, with a breakdown between forced labour and forced marriage.

Overall, Asia and the Pacific was the region with by far the highest number of people in modern slavery, whereas the figures for the other four regions were considerably lower and broadly comparable. In all regions except for the Americas, forced labour accounted for a higher proportion of victims than forced marriage.

Specifically, Asia and the Pacific had an estimated 29.3 million people in modern slavery. This was composed of 15.1 million in forced labour and 14.2 million in forced marriage. The second most affected region was Africa, with a total of 7.0 million victims, split between 3.8 million in forced labour and 3.2 million in forced marriage.

The Americas recorded a total of 5.0 million people in modern slavery, and it was the only region where forced marriage (1.7 million) was slightly more prevalent than forced labour (3.3 million). Europe and Central Asia had a similar total of 4.9 million, but with a clear majority in forced labour (3.5 million). Finally, the Arab States had the lowest number of the regions shown, with 3.8 million people in modern slavery, the vast majority of whom (2.9 million) were in forced labour.

**WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)**

Modern slavery, a blight on our contemporary world, persists as a complex global issue demanding a robust and multifaceted response. It is often debated whether the most potent weapon in this fight is the implementation of stringent legislation and governmental oversight, or the cultivation of widespread consumer awareness and ethical purchasing habits. While both approaches have undeniable merit, I would argue that a synergistic combination of top-down legal frameworks and bottom-up consumer-driven pressure is ultimately required to dismantle the structures that perpetuate this exploitation.

On the one hand, the role of government and international bodies in enacting and enforcing strict laws is indispensable. National and international legislation provides the fundamental architecture for prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, and compelling businesses to act. For instance, laws such as the UK's Modern Slavery Act require large corporations to report on their efforts to eradicate slavery from their supply chains. This legislative pressure creates a non-negotiable baseline for corporate behaviour, moving the issue from the realm of voluntary charity to one of legal compliance. Without the deterrent of legal consequences, including substantial fines and imprisonment for perpetrators, the economic incentives for exploitation would remain largely unchallenged. Governments alone have the authority to police borders, conduct large-scale investigations, and dismantle the organized criminal networks that profit from this trade in human misery.

On the other hand, the power of the consumer in a globalized market should not be underestimated. In an era where brand reputation can be instantly damaged by social media campaigns, companies are increasingly sensitive to public perception. The rise of ethical consumerism, a movement where individuals consciously choose to purchase goods from companies with transparent and humane supply chains, can exert significant economic pressure. When a sufficient number of consumers demand slavery-free products, it forces businesses to investigate their suppliers and invest in ethical sourcing, not merely as a legal formality but as a commercial necessity. This grassroots movement fosters a culture of corporate accountability that can often be more dynamic and responsive than slow-moving legislative change. It empowers every individual to become an agent of change through their daily purchasing decisions.

In conclusion, while both stricter laws and consumer awareness are crucial, they are two sides of the same coin and are most effective when pursued in tandem. Laws provide the essential, non-negotiable framework and the punitive power to deter criminals, while consumer activism provides the constant, market-driven pressure that forces corporations to go beyond mere compliance. The former sets the rules of the game, while the latter ensures the players are held accountable in the court of public opinion. Ultimately, only a concerted effort that combines the might of the state with the moral and economic power of the people can hope to eradicate the scourge of modern slavery.

**SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE**

I’d like to talk about the time I first learned about the issue of ‘fast fashion’ and its connection to modern slavery, which was a real eye-opener for me. I think I was in my first year of university, and I came across it through a documentary I watched on a streaming service. I can’t remember the exact title, but it was all about the hidden costs of cheap clothing.

The documentary was incredibly powerful. It followed the journey of a simple t-shirt, from the cotton fields where workers were paid almost nothing, to the factories where garment workers, mostly young women, were working in appalling conditions for incredibly long hours. What really shocked me was the revelation that many of these workers were essentially trapped in a form of debt bondage, unable to leave their jobs because they owed money to the factory owners for their accommodation and food. It was a form of modern slavery happening right under our noses, hidden in the supply chains of brands I recognized and even wore.

Learning about this had a profound effect on me. Initially, I felt a sense of guilt and complicity. I had never really considered where my clothes came from, I just bought what was cheap and fashionable. The documentary made me realize that my purchasing decisions had real-world consequences, and that I was inadvertently supporting a system of exploitation. It made me much more conscious as a consumer. Since then, I’ve tried to change my habits. I buy fewer clothes, I try to buy from more ethical and sustainable brands, and I’m much more interested in the story behind the products I purchase. It definitely made me a more critical and aware citizen.
