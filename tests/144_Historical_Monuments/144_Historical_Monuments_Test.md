**The Great Wall of China**

The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of Chinese civilization. A vast and complex fortification system, it stretches for thousands of kilometers, traversing a diverse range of terrains, from arid deserts to rugged mountains. While not a single, continuous wall, it is a network of walls, watchtowers, fortresses, and other defensive structures built and rebuilt over centuries by various Chinese dynasties. The Great Wall’s primary purpose was to protect the Chinese Empire from nomadic invaders from the north, particularly the Mongols.

The earliest sections of the wall were constructed as early as the 7th century BC. These were relatively simple constructions of rammed earth and gravel. It was not until the reign of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang (221-210 BC), that the various sections of the wall were joined together and significantly expanded. The Qin dynasty walls were built by a massive workforce of soldiers, convicts, and commoners. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people died during its construction, earning the wall the grim nickname of the “longest cemetery on Earth.”

The Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) further extended and reinforced the wall, adding watchtowers and beacons to improve communication and defense. However, it was during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) that the Great Wall took on the form we are most familiar with today. The Ming rulers, wary of the Mongol threat, invested heavily in the wall’s construction, using bricks and stone to create a more formidable barrier. The Ming-era wall is a testament to the engineering prowess of the time, with its impressive watchtowers, barracks, and signaling stations.

The Great Wall was not just a physical barrier; it also served as a psychological deterrent. Its sheer scale and imposing presence were intended to intimidate potential invaders and demonstrate the power and authority of the Chinese Empire. The wall also played a crucial role in regulating trade and controlling immigration. The famous Silk Road, a network of trade routes connecting the East and West, was in part protected by the Great Wall.

Despite its impressive defenses, the Great Wall was not impregnable. It was breached on several occasions, most notably in the 17th century when the Manchus, a nomadic people from the northeast, bypassed the wall and established the Qing dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of China. The fall of the Ming dynasty marked the end of the Great Wall’s military significance. With the expansion of the Chinese empire under the Qing, the wall no longer served as a frontier defense.

In the modern era, the Great Wall has become a powerful symbol of Chinese national identity and a major tourist attraction. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, and in 2007, it was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. However, the Great Wall faces numerous threats, including erosion, weathering, and damage from tourism. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to protect and preserve this invaluable cultural treasure, but the task is a challenging one given the wall’s immense scale and the vastness of the area it covers.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**A Tale of Two Cities: Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu**

**A**
High in the Andes Mountains of Peru, the enigmatic ruins of Machu Picchu stand as a testament to the ingenuity of the Inca Empire. Across the globe, nestled in the lush jungles of Cambodia, the sprawling temple complex of Angkor Wat reflects the spiritual and artistic achievements of the Khmer civilization. Both are UNESCO World Heritage sites, attracting millions of visitors each year, yet they tell vastly different stories of human ambition, cultural expression, and the inexorable passage of time.

**B**
Machu Picchu, believed to have been built in the mid-15th century as a royal estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, is a marvel of engineering. Its stone structures, seamlessly integrated into the natural landscape, were constructed without the use of mortar. The Incas were masters of a technique called ashlar masonry, in which stones were cut so precisely that they fit together perfectly. This method not only created aesthetically pleasing structures but also made them remarkably resistant to earthquakes, a common occurrence in the region. The site is divided into distinct sectors, including an agricultural zone with extensive terracing, a residential area, and a sacred district with prominent structures like the Temple of the Sun and the Intihuatana stone, a mysterious carved rock that may have served as a solar clock or calendar.

**C**
Angkor Wat, on the other hand, was built in the early 12th century by the Khmer King Suryavarman II. It was originally conceived as a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu, and its design is a microcosm of the Hindu universe. The central tower, rising to a height of nearly 70 feet, represents Mount Meru, the mythical home of the gods. The surrounding walls and moat symbolize the mountains and oceans of the world. Unlike Machu Picchu, which was built with stone from the surrounding mountains, Angkor Wat was constructed using sandstone blocks transported from a quarry over 30 miles away. The temple walls are adorned with intricate bas-reliefs depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and historical events, providing a rich visual narrative of the Khmer culture.

**D**
Both Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat were eventually abandoned, though for different reasons. Machu Picchu was inhabited for less than a century. The reasons for its abandonment remain a mystery, with theories ranging from the Spanish conquest to a smallpox epidemic. The site was never discovered by the Spanish and lay hidden from the outside world until its rediscovery by the American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. This has led to its romanticized image as the “Lost City of the Incas.”

**E**
Angkor Wat’s decline was more gradual. The Khmer capital shifted several times over the centuries, and by the 13th century, Angkor was no longer the political or commercial center of the empire. The temple itself was never completely abandoned, however, and was later converted into a Buddhist monastery. It fell into a state of disrepair over the centuries, with the jungle slowly reclaiming the stone structures. It was “rediscovered” by the French explorer Henri Mouhot in the 1840s, who was captivated by its grandeur and brought it to the attention of the Western world.

**F**
Today, both sites face the challenges of mass tourism and environmental degradation. The sheer number of visitors puts a strain on the fragile structures and the surrounding environment. In recent years, both the Peruvian and Cambodian governments, with the support of international organizations, have implemented measures to protect these invaluable cultural treasures. These include limiting the number of daily visitors, restoring damaged structures, and promoting sustainable tourism practices. The preservation of these magnificent monuments is a complex and ongoing task, but it is essential to ensure that future generations can continue to marvel at the achievements of these ancient civilizations.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Preservation of Historical Monuments**

The preservation of historical monuments is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, fraught with challenges that range from the physical decay of ancient structures to the ethical dilemmas of restoration. As we seek to protect these invaluable links to our past, we are confronted with a host of scientific, financial, and philosophical questions. How do we balance the need to preserve the authenticity of a monument with the desire to make it accessible and understandable to a modern audience? What are the most effective methods for combating the relentless forces of nature and the destructive impact of human activity? And who should bear the responsibility for safeguarding our shared cultural heritage?

One of the most significant challenges in monument preservation is the constant battle against environmental threats. Air pollution, acid rain, and extreme weather events all take their toll on ancient stone, brick, and mortar. The gradual erosion caused by wind and rain, the chemical reactions triggered by pollutants, and the sudden devastation of earthquakes and floods all pose a grave danger to our historical legacy. In recent years, climate change has emerged as a major exacerbating factor, with rising sea levels threatening coastal sites and changing weather patterns accelerating the decay of fragile materials. To counter these threats, conservators employ a wide range of scientific techniques, from the development of specialized cleaning agents to the application of protective coatings and the installation of sophisticated monitoring systems.

Financial constraints are another major obstacle to effective preservation. The cost of restoring and maintaining historical monuments can be astronomical, often running into the millions or even billions of dollars. Many countries, particularly those with a wealth of historical sites but limited economic resources, struggle to allocate sufficient funds for preservation efforts. This is where international organizations like UNESCO and the World Monuments Fund play a crucial role, providing financial assistance, technical expertise, and a platform for international cooperation. However, the demand for funding far outstrips the available resources, and many important sites remain at risk due to a lack of financial support.

Beyond the practical challenges of conservation, there are also complex ethical considerations to navigate. The very act of restoration can be a contentious issue. To what extent should we intervene in the natural aging process of a monument? Should we aim to restore a site to its original state, or should we preserve it in its current, ruinous condition? The Venice Charter, a key international document on conservation, emphasizes the importance of respecting the historical and aesthetic value of a monument in all its phases. It advocates for a minimalist approach to restoration, with a focus on repair rather than replacement, and a clear distinction between original material and modern additions.

Furthermore, the increasing commercialization of historical sites presents a double-edged sword. While tourism can generate much-needed revenue for preservation efforts, it can also be a major source of damage. The sheer volume of visitors can lead to wear and tear on fragile structures, and the development of tourist infrastructure can have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. Striking a balance between promoting tourism and protecting the integrity of a site is a delicate and ongoing challenge. The concept of sustainable tourism, which seeks to minimize the negative impacts of tourism while maximizing its benefits for local communities and conservation, offers a promising way forward.

Ultimately, the preservation of historical monuments is a shared responsibility. It requires the collaboration of governments, international organizations, local communities, and individuals. By fostering a greater appreciation for our cultural heritage and by supporting the work of those dedicated to its protection, we can ensure that these irreplaceable treasures continue to inspire and inform future generations. The monuments of the past are not merely relics of a bygone era; they are living testaments to the enduring power of human creativity and the rich tapestry of our collective history.

**(Audio Script for Section 2)**

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the magnificent Borobudur Temple. My name is David, and I’ll be your guide for today’s tour. Before we begin, I’d like to give you a brief overview of this incredible monument.

Borobudur is the world’s largest Buddhist temple, and it was built in the 9th century during the reign of the Sailendra Dynasty. It’s a truly remarkable feat of engineering and artistry, and it’s considered one of the greatest Buddhist monuments in the world. The temple is located in a beautiful, peaceful valley, surrounded by lush green rice fields and distant volcanoes.

The temple is built in the form of a giant mandala, and it consists of nine stacked platforms, six square and three circular, topped by a central dome. The entire structure is decorated with over 2,500 relief panels and 504 Buddha statues. The intricate carvings on the walls depict scenes from the life of the Buddha and other important Buddhist teachings.

Now, let’s talk about some of the key features of the temple. The main tower, which is the highest point of the temple, offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding landscape. It’s a popular spot for watching the sunrise, and I highly recommend it if you have the chance. The inner courtyard, which is located on the upper platforms, is a place of quiet contemplation. It’s a great place to sit and soak up the spiritual atmosphere of the temple.

The royal chambers, which are located on the lower platforms, are unfortunately not open to the public. They are currently undergoing restoration work to preserve the delicate carvings and sculptures inside. The west gate is the main entrance to the temple, and it’s where you’ll find the ticket office and visitor center. Finally, the north wall is the oldest part of the monument. It’s a great place to see the original stonework and get a sense of the temple’s long and fascinating history.

So, without further ado, let’s begin our tour. Please follow me, and don’t hesitate to ask any questions you may have.

**(Audio Script for Section 3)**

**Maria:** So, John, how’s your presentation coming along?

**John:** It’s going well, Maria. I’ve done a lot of research on the challenges of preserving historical monuments. It’s a really interesting topic.

**Maria:** I agree. I’m working on the same topic for my presentation. What do you think is the biggest challenge?

**John:** That’s a tough question. There are so many challenges. But if I had to choose one, I’d say it’s the environmental threats. You know, things like air pollution, acid rain, and climate change.

**Maria:** I see your point. But I think the financial constraints are an even bigger challenge. It costs a fortune to restore and maintain these old buildings. And many countries just don’t have the money.

**John:** That’s true. But even if you have the money, you can’t stop the forces of nature. Acid rain, for example, can cause the stone to crumble and the intricate carvings to disappear. And with climate change, we’re seeing more extreme weather events, which can cause even more damage.

**Maria:** I suppose so. But what about rising sea levels? I was reading about Venice, and how the city is slowly sinking. That’s a huge threat to all the historical buildings there.

**John:** Exactly. And it’s not just Venice. There are many other coastal sites that are at risk. But let’s get back to the financial side of things. You said it costs a fortune to restore these monuments. How much are we talking about?

**Maria:** Well, it depends on the monument, of course. But I read about one restoration project that cost over a billion dollars. And that was just for one monument.

**John:** A billion dollars? That’s an incredible amount of money. Where does it all come from?

**Maria:** A lot of it comes from international organizations like UNESCO. But they can’t fund everything. So, many countries have to rely on private donations and tourism revenue.

**John:** Ah, tourism. That’s another interesting aspect of the problem. On the one hand, tourism can bring in much-needed money for preservation. But on the other hand, it can also cause a lot of damage.

**Maria:** I know what you mean. The sheer number of visitors can lead to wear and tear on the monuments. And the development of tourist infrastructure can have a negative impact on the environment.

**John:** And then there’s the issue of commercialization. I hate it when historical sites are turned into theme parks, with souvenir shops and fast-food restaurants everywhere.

**Maria:** Me too. It really takes away from the experience. So, I guess we agree that preservation is a complex issue with no easy answers.

**John:** Absolutely. It’s a delicate balancing act between protecting our heritage and making it accessible to everyone.

**(Audio Script for Section 4)**

Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, I’m going to be talking about the role of technology in the preservation of historical monuments. As we’ve discussed in previous lectures, the preservation of our cultural heritage is a complex and challenging task. But thanks to advances in technology, we now have a range of powerful new tools at our disposal.

One of the most exciting new technologies is laser scanning. This technology allows us to create a highly detailed 3D digital model of a monument. This model can then be used to monitor the monument for any changes or signs of deterioration. It can also be used to create virtual reality simulations, which can be used for research and education.

Another technology that is proving to be very useful is drones. Drones can be used to inspect the hard-to-reach parts of a monument, such as the roof or the upper sections of a tower. They can also be used to create high-resolution aerial photographs and videos, which can be used to document the condition of the monument and to plan restoration work.

3D printing is another technology that has the potential to revolutionize the field of monument preservation. With 3D printing, we can create precise replicas of damaged or missing parts of a monument. These replicas can be made from a variety of materials, including plastic, metal, and even stone. This means that we can restore a monument to its original condition without causing any damage to the original fabric.

Of course, the use of technology in preservation is a rapidly developing field, and there are still many challenges to overcome. There are also some limitations to consider, such as the cost and the need for specialized skills. However, the potential benefits of technology are enormous. By harnessing the power of technology, we can ensure that our precious cultural heritage is preserved for generations to come.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The preservation of historical monuments is a contentious issue that often sparks debate. While some argue that these sites should be protected at any cost as they represent our cultural heritage, others contend that the substantial funds required for their upkeep could be better allocated to more immediate societal needs like healthcare and education. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

On the one hand, historical monuments are irreplaceable links to our past. They provide invaluable insights into the civilizations that came before us, offering a tangible connection to history that cannot be replicated by books or documentaries. For instance, visiting the Colosseum in Rome or the Great Wall of China allows us to appreciate the architectural and engineering prowess of ancient civilizations. These monuments also foster a sense of national identity and pride, serving as powerful symbols of a country’s history and cultural achievements. Furthermore, they are a significant source of tourism revenue, which can boost local economies and create jobs. Therefore, the argument for preserving them at all costs is rooted in their immense cultural, educational, and economic value.

On the other hand, the financial burden of preserving historical monuments can be immense. The restoration and maintenance of these often-fragile structures require substantial and continuous investment. Critics argue that in a world where many people lack access to basic healthcare and quality education, spending billions on old buildings is a misallocation of resources. They propose that this money could be used to build hospitals, improve schools, or fund medical research, thereby addressing more pressing human needs. From this perspective, while historical monuments are important, they should not take precedence over the well-being of the current population.

In my opinion, while the arguments for prioritizing immediate societal needs are valid, the preservation of historical monuments should not be seen as a mutually exclusive goal. A balanced approach is necessary. Governments should seek innovative funding solutions, such as public-private partnerships and international cooperation, to minimize the financial strain on public funds. Moreover, the revenue generated from tourism at these sites can be reinvested into their preservation and also contribute to the local community’s development. Ultimately, historical monuments are not just relics of the past; they are assets that can enrich our present and future. Therefore, while we must address the pressing needs of our society, we also have a responsibility to safeguard our shared cultural heritage for generations to come.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

(The candidate has one minute to prepare and can make notes.)

I’d like to talk about a historical monument I visited a few years ago, which is the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. It’s a truly remarkable place, located in a remote desert canyon in the south of the country.

What’s most striking about Petra is that the entire city is carved out of the rose-red sandstone cliffs. The most famous structure is the Treasury, or Al-Khazneh, which you might recognize from the Indiana Jones movies. It’s an incredibly ornate and imposing building, with a beautiful facade of columns, statues, and intricate carvings. But Petra is much more than just the Treasury. It’s a vast complex of tombs, temples, and houses, all carved into the rock. There’s also a Roman-style theatre and a long colonnaded street, which gives you a sense of what a bustling city it must have been in its heyday.

I visited Petra with my family during a trip to Jordan about three years ago. We spent a whole day exploring the site, and it was an unforgettable experience. We walked through the Siq, which is a narrow gorge that serves as the main entrance to the city. The walk itself is breathtaking, with the towering cliffs on either side. And then, at the end of the Siq, you get your first glimpse of the Treasury, which is a truly magical moment.

I think Petra is an incredibly important monument for several reasons. Firstly, it’s a testament to the ingenuity and artistic skill of the Nabataeans, the ancient Arab people who built it. They were masters of water engineering, which allowed them to create a thriving city in the middle of the desert. Secondly, Petra was a major trading hub, connecting Arabia, Egypt, and Syria. So, it played a crucial role in the history of the region. And finally, it’s a place of outstanding natural beauty, where the works of man and nature have combined to create something truly unique. It’s no wonder that it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
