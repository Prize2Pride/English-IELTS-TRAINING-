**PASSAGE 1**

U.S. immigration law is based on the following principles: the reunification of families, admitting immigrants with skills that are valuable to the U.S. economy, humanitarian protections, and promoting diversity. The law governing U.S. immigration policy is called the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA allows the United States to grant up to 675,000 permanent immigrant visas each year across various visa categories. On top of those 675,000 visas, the INA sets no limit on the annual admission of U.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children under the age of 21. In addition, each year the president is required to consult with Congress and set an annual number of refugees to be admitted to the United States through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Finally, humanitarian protections such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status, and other programs which may permit someone to reside in the United States legally do not have numerical caps, but do have other restrictions.

Once a person is granted an immigrant visa or receives certain other eligible protections, such as asylum or refugee status, they can apply to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR). Individuals arriving on immigrant visas become LPRs when they arrive in the United States. After residing in the United States for five years (or three years in some circumstances), LPRs are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. There is no requirement that an LPR apply for citizenship. LPRs are eligible to apply for nearly all jobs (i.e., jobs not legitimately restricted to U.S. citizens) and are permitted to remain in the country permanently, while still remaining subject to immigration laws.

Family unification is an important principle governing U.S. immigration policy. The family-based immigration system allows U.S. citizens and LPRs to enable certain family members to gain LPR status as well. An unlimited number of visas are available every year for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Prospective immigrants in this category must meet standard eligibility criteria, and petitioners must meet certain age and financial requirements. Immediate relatives are spouses of U.S. citizens, unmarried minor children of U.S. citizens (under 21 years old), and parents of U.S. citizens (petitioner must be at least 21 years old to petition for a parent). An additional limited number of visas are available every year under the family preference system for other non-immediate family members.

In order to be admitted through the family-based immigration system, a U.S. citizen or LPR sponsor must petition for an individual relative, establish the legitimacy of the relationship, meet minimum income requirements, and sign an affidavit of support stating that the sponsor will be financially responsible for the family member(s) upon arrival in the United States or adjustment to LPR status within the United States. The individual relative must also meet certain eligibility requirements that include submitting to a medical exam and obtaining required vaccinations, an analysis of any immigration or criminal history, as well as demonstrating that they will not become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.

The United States also provides various ways for immigrants with valuable skills to come to the country on either a temporary or a permanent basis. Temporary employment-based visa classifications permit employers to hire and petition for foreign nationals for specific jobs for limited periods. Most temporary workers must work for the employer that petitioned for them and have limited ability to change jobs. There are more than 20 types of visas for temporary nonimmigrant workers. These include L-1 visas for intracompany transfers; various P visas for athletes, entertainers, and skilled performers; R-1 visas for religious workers; various A visas for diplomatic employees; O-1 visas for workers of extraordinary ability; and various H visas for both highly skilled and lesser-skilled workers. The visa classifications vary in terms of their eligibility requirements, duration, whether they permit workers to bring dependents, and other factors.

**PASSAGE 2**

The question of whether immigration represents a net cost or a net benefit to the U.S. economy has been a major source of contention, even as the research literature and thinking among economists has been quite clear. Sifting through the full economic and fiscal impacts of immigration is a complex task, but a strong body of research and consensus by most economists finds that immigration, on balance, is a net positive for the U.S. economy. Still, the public debate over economic impacts continues, as some observers highlight immigrants’ tax payments and labor force contributions, while others underscore education, health care, and other costs to governments.

**A**
Immigrants boost overall economic growth by expanding the labor force and increasing consumer spending. The foreign born also start new businesses at higher rates than U.S.-born individuals. Immigrants were involved in the development of 30 percent of patents in strategic industries in recent years, and more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants. Higher-than-expected immigration is driving job growth and productivity and is projected to continue doing so in the coming years: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the greater level of immigration expected between 2024 and 2034 will boost gross domestic product (GDP) by $8.9 trillion.

**B**
While immigrants—like U.S.-born individuals—cost governments money for services such as public education, health care, basic infrastructure such as sewer systems and roads, and sometimes public benefits, they also pay into government budgets through sales taxes; property taxes (either directly as homeowners or indirectly through rent payments); and through payroll deductions, taxes on income as well as for Medicare and Social Security. Even unauthorized immigrants who lack work authorization pay these taxes: on top of sales and property taxes, many work on the books using a fake Social Security number or one belonging to another worker, and as a result pay payroll taxes.

**C**
On balance, do these payments exceed the government spending that immigrants receive? At the federal level, immigrants pay more in taxes over time than they use in government services and benefits, according to a landmark report by the National Academy of Sciences and a range of more recent studies. The picture is different at the state and local level. Immigrants tend to cost local governments more than they pay in, primarily due to the cost of their children’s public schooling.

**D**
Immigration has been the major driving force behind U.S. labor force growth over the past 20 years, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between 2000 and 2022, the foreign born accounted for nearly three-quarters of all growth in the civilian, prime-age (age 25 to 54) labor force. As the U.S. population ages and more U.S.-born residents enter retirement, immigration will become increasingly important for driving labor force growth. Due to population aging, the number of U.S.-born people of prime working age (age 25-54) hardly changed between 2000 and 2022. In contrast, the number of foreign-born people of prime working age grew by almost 7 million over this period. And the U.S.-born senior population (age 65 and older) grew by almost 18 million over the same timeframe.

**E**
While immigration skeptics have charged that immigrants take jobs from the U.S. born, in particular Black workers, the evidence demonstrates that immigrants have taken a larger slice of a growing jobs pie over recent decades rather than displacing American workers. The number of U.S. jobs is not fixed: In addition to filling jobs, immigrants also foster job growth by consuming goods and services and by starting businesses.

**F**
Because immigrants are more likely to appear both at the higher and lower ends of the educational spectrum than the U.S. born, they often fill jobs that complement those held by U.S.-born workers. Some immigrants have skills that most U.S. workers lack (specialized engineering skills, for example), while others fill jobs that are not attractive to U.S. workers because of the wages or working conditions (for example, in agriculture or roofing). The U.S. workers who face the most direct competition from immigrants are those without high school diplomas, including other immigrants who came earlier. Those workers are most likely to see their wages lowered by immigration. But these wage effects are small, with most studies finding that immigration results in wage declines of just a few percentage points or no wage effects at all.

**PASSAGE 3**

The social problems of immigrants and migrants include poverty, acculturation, education, housing, employment, and social functionality. Family problems of immigrants and migrants include leaving the support system of the extended family behind, causing stress and financial difficulties if job search efforts are unsuccessful, differing perceptions of the concepts of basic human rights, and differing perceptions of the roles and responsibilities among family members. Policy issues designed to address the needs of immigrant and migrant families must be heavily weighted in favor of local control and administration. One approach to solving immigrant and migrant problems may be to provide direct services through some form of education or intervention. Often the critical issues facing both the migrant and immigrant population which migrates are basic literacy and methods for achieving this goal in a constantly mobile population. Poverty among migrant and immigrant families continues to increase. Even though the new immigration laws are intended to stabilize the conditions of immigrants and migrants in the US, in general, the social impact of a large and growing population of immigrant and migrant families is negative.

Characteristics of immigrant and migrant populations in the US include 1) the newest immigrants are mainly from southeast Asia, commonly political refugees, and often their multi-generational families join them; 2) the largest and oldest group is Hispanics who are mostly farm workers and now have complete families with them; and 3) whites and blacks who usually move for greater economic prosperity. The author concludes that the US should 1) permit a flexible quota system which would be sensitive to the fluctuations in labor needs, 2) deemphasize the family reunification aspect of the immigration policy and redress occupational qualifications as important criteria for US entry, 3) look more carefully at the unique characteristics of the various migrant groups and decide upon social needs accordingly, and 4) attend to social welfare issues.

The author discusses various social problems resulting from migration to and within the United States, including poverty, acculturation, education, housing, employment, social adjustment, and family difficulties. The potential impact of migrants on the U.S. society and economy is assessed, and government policy responses to their problems are considered. The social problems of immigrants and migrants include 1) poverty, 2) acculturation, 3) education, 4) housing, 5) employment, and 6) social functionality. Family problems of immigrants and migrants include 1) leaving the support system of the extended family behind, 2) causing stress and financial difficulties if job search efforts are unsuccessful, 3) differing perceptions of the concepts of basic human rights, and 4) differing perceptions of the roles and responsibilities among family members. Policy issues designed to address the needs of immigrant and migrant families must be heavily weighted in favor of local control and administration. One approach to solving immigrant and migrant problems may be to provide direct services through some form of education or intervention. Often the critical issues facing both the migrant and immigrant population which migrates are basic literacy and methods for achieving this goal in a constantly mobile population. Poverty among migrant and immigrant families continues to increase. Even though the new immigration laws are intended to stabilize the conditions of immigrants and migrants in the US, in general, the social impact of a large and growing population of immigrant and migrant families is negative.

Good morning everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is David, and I’m from an organization called Migrant Support. We’re a non-profit organization that helps migrants to settle into life in the UK. We were founded in 1983, and we’ve been helping migrants ever since. Our main purpose is to help migrants to integrate into society. We do this by providing a range of services, including language classes, employment workshops, and housing advice. We are funded by a combination of government grants and private donations. We believe that all migrants should have the opportunity to build a new life in the UK, and we’re here to help them do that.

One of the biggest challenges for new migrants is finding accommodation. That’s why we offer a housing advice service. We can help you to find a place to live, and we can also provide you with information about your rights and responsibilities as a tenant. We also offer employment workshops to help you find a job. We can help you to write a CV, prepare for interviews, and search for jobs online. And if you need to improve your English, we offer language classes for all levels, from beginner to advanced.

We also provide a range of services for specific groups of people. For refugees, we offer legal support to help them with their asylum claims. For asylum seekers, we provide healthcare assistance to ensure they have access to the medical care they need. For skilled migrants, we offer employment workshops to help them find a job that matches their qualifications. For international students, we provide housing advice to help them find a place to live. And for families with young children, we offer childcare services to help them balance their work and family commitments.

We believe that by providing these services, we can help migrants to overcome the challenges they face and to build a successful new life in the UK. If you’d like to find out more about our services, please visit our website at www.migrantsupport.org.uk. Thank you.

**SECTION 3**

**Tutor:** So, Sarah and Tom, you’ve been looking at the economic and social effects of immigration. What have you found?

**Sarah:** Well, we found that the economic effects of immigration are generally positive. Immigrants contribute to the economy by filling labor shortages, starting businesses, and paying taxes. They also boost consumer spending.

**Tom:** But there can also be some negative economic effects. For example, some studies have shown that immigration can lead to a small decrease in wages for low-skilled workers. And it can also put a strain on public services, such as schools and hospitals.

**Tutor:** That’s a good point, Tom. It’s important to look at both the positive and negative effects. What about the social effects of immigration?

**Sarah:** The social effects are more complex. On the one hand, immigration can lead to a more diverse and vibrant society. It can also help to challenge stereotypes and promote intercultural understanding.

**Tom:** On the other hand, it can also lead to social tension and conflict. This is more likely to happen if immigrants are not well-integrated into society, or if there is competition for resources, such as jobs and housing.

**Tutor:** So, what do you think is the most important factor for successful integration?

**Sarah:** I think language proficiency is the most important factor. If immigrants can’t speak the language, it’s very difficult for them to find a job, make friends, and participate in society.

**Tom:** I agree. But I also think that employment is very important. If immigrants have a job, they are more likely to feel a sense of belonging and to be accepted by the local community.

**Tutor:** Those are both very important points. For your next assignment, I’d like you to research a specific case study of immigration. You could look at a particular group of immigrants in a particular city, for example. I want you to analyze the economic and social effects of immigration in that case, and to evaluate the policies that have been put in place to promote integration. The deadline for this assignment is in three weeks. Any questions?

**Sarah:** No, I don’t think so.

**Tom:** No, that’s clear. Thank you.

**Tutor:** Okay. I look forward to reading your assignments.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at immigration policies. We’ll be discussing the different types of immigration policies, the factors that influence them, and the challenges that governments face in this area.

So, what are the different types of immigration policies? Broadly speaking, we can divide them into three categories. First, there are economic policies, which are designed to attract skilled workers and investors. These policies are often used by developed countries to fill labor shortages and to boost their economies. Second, there are social policies, which focus on family reunification. These policies allow citizens and permanent residents to bring their family members to live with them. Third, there are humanitarian policies, which are designed to protect refugees and asylum seekers. These policies are based on international law and on a country’s moral obligations.

Now, let’s turn to the factors that influence immigration policies. One of the most important factors is a country’s economic needs. For example, a country with an aging population may need to attract more young workers to support its economy. Another important factor is demographic concerns. For example, a country may want to limit immigration to maintain its cultural identity or to prevent overcrowding. International obligations are also a key factor. For example, countries that have signed the 1951 Refugee Convention have a legal duty to protect refugees. Finally, public opinion can also play a significant role. If there is strong public opposition to immigration, the government may be forced to adopt more restrictive policies.

So, what are the challenges in immigration policy? One of the biggest challenges is balancing economic needs with social concerns. For example, a country may need to attract more immigrants to fill labor shortages, but this may lead to social tension if the new immigrants are not well-integrated. Another challenge is ensuring the integration of migrants. This includes providing language classes, employment support, and access to public services. Finally, there is the challenge of managing the social and cultural impact of immigration. This includes promoting intercultural understanding and preventing discrimination.

In the next part of the lecture, we’ll be looking at some specific examples of immigration policies from around the world.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates the number of immigrants to the United States from five different countries in the year 2026. The countries are Mexico, Cuba, India, the Dominican Republic, and China.

Overall, Mexico was by far the largest source of immigrants to the US in 2026, with the number of Mexican immigrants being more than double that of the second-highest country, Cuba. The remaining three countries, India, the Dominican Republic, and China, all contributed a significantly smaller number of immigrants.

To be more specific, the number of immigrants from Mexico stood at 180,530, which was a substantial figure compared to the other countries. Cuba was the second-largest contributor, with 81,600 immigrants. This was followed by India and the Dominican Republic, with 78,070 and 68,870 immigrants respectively. The country with the fewest immigrants among the five was China, with 59,260 people moving to the US in 2026.

The chart clearly shows a significant disparity in the number of immigrants from different countries, with Mexico being the dominant source of immigration to the US in the given year.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The debate over immigration policies is a complex and often contentious one, with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that strict immigration controls are essential for national security and economic stability, others contend that a more open approach is a moral imperative. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

On the one hand, proponents of strict immigration policies raise legitimate concerns about the potential risks of uncontrolled immigration. They argue that a nation has the right to protect its borders and to ensure that those who enter are not a threat to national security. This is particularly pertinent in an age of global terrorism, where the need to vet new arrivals is paramount. Furthermore, from an economic standpoint, it is argued that a large influx of immigrants can place a strain on public services, such as schools, healthcare, and social welfare systems. It is also suggested that an oversupply of labor can drive down wages for native-born workers, particularly in low-skilled sectors. Therefore, a restrictive immigration policy is seen as a prudent measure to safeguard the interests of the existing population.

On the other hand, those who advocate for more lenient immigration policies often do so from a humanitarian standpoint. They argue that developed nations have a moral obligation to offer refuge to those fleeing war, persecution, or poverty. This perspective is rooted in the idea of a shared humanity and the belief that everyone has the right to seek a better life. Moreover, it is argued that immigration can be a significant economic boon. Immigrants often fill labor shortages, start businesses at a high rate, and contribute to innovation and economic growth. They also pay taxes, which can help to fund the very public services that they use. From this point of view, a welcoming immigration policy is not only a moral duty but also a smart economic strategy.

In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most sensible way forward. While it is crucial for a country to maintain secure borders and to have a system for vetting new arrivals, it is also important to recognize the significant contributions that immigrants make to society. A fair and well-managed immigration system can be beneficial for both the host country and the immigrants themselves. This could involve a points-based system that prioritizes skilled workers, while also maintaining a commitment to family reunification and humanitarian protection. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a system that is both secure and compassionate, and that recognizes the value of immigration in a globalized world.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

An immigration policy that I have recently read about is the points-based system used by countries like Canada and Australia. This policy is designed to attract skilled workers who can contribute to the economy. Applicants are awarded points based on factors such as their age, education, work experience, and language proficiency. The higher their score, the more likely they are to be granted a visa.

This policy is used by several countries, but I will focus on the Canadian system. Canada has been using a points-based system for many years, and it is widely regarded as a successful model for managing immigration. The effects of this policy have been largely positive. It has helped Canada to attract a diverse and highly skilled workforce, which has contributed to its economic growth and innovation. It has also helped to ensure that immigrants are well-prepared for life in Canada and are able to integrate into society more easily.

I believe that this is a good policy because it is fair and transparent. It is based on objective criteria, rather than on an individual's country of origin or family connections. This means that everyone has an equal opportunity to apply, and the selection process is based on merit. It also benefits the host country by ensuring that it is attracting immigrants who have the skills and qualifications that are in demand. Of course, no system is perfect, and there are always challenges in managing immigration. However, I think that the points-based system is a sensible and effective way to balance the needs of the host country with the aspirations of those who wish to immigrate.
