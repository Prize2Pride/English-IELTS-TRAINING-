**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Gift of Life: An Overview of Organ and Blood Donation**

Every year, millions of lives are saved and improved through the simple yet profound act of donation. Organ and blood donation, while distinct processes, share a common thread: the selfless gift from one individual to another, often a stranger. This act of generosity provides a second chance at life for those with life-threatening illnesses or injuries.

Blood donation is a familiar concept to many. It is a safe and straightforward procedure where a volunteer gives blood to be used for transfusions. A single donation of whole blood, typically about a pint, can be separated into its components—red blood cells, plasma, and platelets—and can help save up to three lives. The need for blood is constant, with patients requiring it for a variety of reasons, including surgery, accidents, and treatment for diseases like cancer. There are different types of blood donation, such as whole blood donation, and apheresis, where only specific components like platelets or plasma are collected. The process is simple: after a health screening, a sterile needle is used to draw blood from a vein in the arm. The entire process usually takes less than an hour, with the actual donation lasting about 10 minutes.

Organ donation is a more complex process that involves the transplantation of a healthy organ from a donor to a recipient whose own organ is failing. This can involve deceased donors, who have registered their intent to donate their organs after death, or living donors. A single deceased donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation and enhance the lives of many more through tissue donation. Organs that can be donated after death include the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, pancreas, and intestines. Living donation is also an option for certain organs, such as a single kidney or a portion of the liver, lung, or pancreas. The decision to become an organ donor is a personal one, and it is crucial for individuals to register their wishes and inform their families.

The process of organ transplantation is a race against time. When a potential deceased donor is identified, a rigorous process begins to ensure the viability of the organs and to find a suitable recipient. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the United States maintains a national database of individuals waiting for a transplant. A computer system matches donors to recipients based on factors like blood type, body size, and medical urgency. Once a match is found, a surgical team recovers the organs, which are then transported to the recipient's hospital for transplantation. The identities of the donor and recipient are kept confidential unless both parties agree to share them.

While the medical advancements in transplantation have been remarkable, the demand for organs far outweighs the supply. In the United States alone, over 100,000 people are on the waiting list for a life-saving organ transplant. The ethical considerations surrounding organ donation are also complex. Issues such as informed consent, the definition of brain death, and the allocation of organs are subjects of ongoing debate. However, the core principle remains the same: to save lives and improve the quality of life for those in need.

Both organ and blood donation are acts of immense kindness that have a profound impact on individuals and society. They represent the best of humanity—the willingness to help others without expectation of reward. By understanding the processes and the critical need for donors, more people can be encouraged to make the life-saving decision to donate.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**A Journey Through Time: The History of Donation and Transplantation**

**A.** The concept of transplanting organs and tissues is not a modern invention. Ancient myths and legends contain stories of miraculous healing and the replacement of body parts. However, the scientific journey of organ and blood donation is a more recent and equally fascinating story. It is a tale of pioneering surgeons, scientific breakthroughs, and the evolution of a medical practice that has saved and transformed countless lives.

**B.** The history of blood transfusion is a long and often perilous one. Early attempts in the 17th century involved transfusing animal blood into humans, with predictably disastrous results. It was not until the 19th century that James Blundell, a British obstetrician, performed the first successful human-to-human blood transfusion. However, the practice remained risky due to the lack of understanding of blood types. The discovery of the ABO blood group system by Karl Landsteiner in 1901 was a pivotal moment. This breakthrough made it possible to match donor and recipient blood types, dramatically increasing the safety and effectiveness of transfusions.

**C.** The 20th century witnessed the dawn of organ transplantation. The first successful human organ transplant, a kidney transplant, was performed in 1954 by Dr. Joseph Murray in Boston. This groundbreaking surgery was conducted between identical twins, which circumvented the problem of organ rejection. The success of this operation opened the door to further research and development in the field. The 1960s saw the first successful liver, heart, and pancreas transplants, pushing the boundaries of what was thought to be medically possible.

**D.** The greatest challenge in organ transplantation has always been the body's natural tendency to reject foreign tissue. The development of immunosuppressant drugs was a critical step in overcoming this obstacle. The introduction of Cyclosporine in the 1980s revolutionized the field. This powerful drug suppressed the immune system, preventing it from attacking the transplanted organ. This led to a significant increase in the success rate of transplants and a surge in the number of procedures performed.

**E.** As the field of transplantation advanced, the need for a coordinated system to manage organ procurement and allocation became apparent. In the United States, the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). This network created a national system for matching donors to recipients in a fair and equitable manner. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) was awarded the contract to operate the OPTN, and it continues to manage the nation's organ transplant system today.

**F.** The history of donation and transplantation is a testament to human ingenuity and the relentless pursuit of medical advancement. From the early, often-fatal experiments with blood transfusion to the routine success of organ transplants today, the journey has been remarkable. The future of transplantation holds even more promise, with ongoing research into areas such as xenotransplantation (the transplantation of organs from animals to humans) and the development of artificial organs. These innovations may one day provide a solution to the persistent shortage of donor organs, offering hope to the thousands of people on the waiting list.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Complex Web of Ethics and Society in Donation**

The act of donating organs and blood is universally regarded as a noble and life-saving gesture. However, beneath this surface of altruism lies a complex web of ethical, cultural, and societal considerations that shape the landscape of donation. These issues are not always black and white, and they continue to be the subject of intense debate among medical professionals, ethicists, and the general public.

One of the most fundamental ethical principles in organ donation is informed consent. This principle dictates that a person must voluntarily agree to donate their organs, with a full understanding of the implications. For deceased donors, this is typically achieved through donor registration. However, the situation becomes more complex when a person has not registered their wishes. In such cases, the decision often falls to the family, who may be struggling with grief and uncertainty. The question of whether a family should have the right to override a registered donor's decision is a contentious one.

Another significant ethical challenge is the allocation of organs. With the demand for organs far exceeding the supply, the process of deciding who receives a transplant is fraught with difficulty. The allocation system aims to be fair and equitable, prioritizing those in most urgent need. However, questions of fairness can arise. Should a person's lifestyle choices, such as smoking or alcohol abuse, affect their eligibility for a transplant? Should a younger person be given priority over an older person? These are difficult questions with no easy answers.

The concept of brain death is also a source of ethical and cultural debate. In many countries, a person is declared legally dead when their brain has irreversibly ceased to function, even if their heart is still beating. This is the point at which organ procurement from deceased donors can begin. However, some cultures and religions have different definitions of death, which can lead to conflicts with the medical practice of organ donation. Understanding and respecting these diverse cultural and religious beliefs is crucial for building trust and encouraging donation within all communities.

Societal attitudes towards blood and organ donation also play a significant role. While many people express support for donation, the number of registered donors often falls short of the need. Misconceptions and fears about donation can be a major barrier. Some people worry that doctors will not work as hard to save their life if they are a registered organ donor. Others may have religious or cultural objections. Public education campaigns are vital for dispelling these myths and promoting a culture of donation.

In recent years, new ethical dilemmas have emerged with advances in medical technology. The possibility of xenotransplantation, the transplantation of animal organs into humans, raises a host of ethical concerns. Is it right to use animals in this way? What are the risks of transmitting animal diseases to humans? Similarly, the development of a market for organs, where people could be paid for donating, is a highly controversial topic. While it could potentially increase the supply of organs, it also raises concerns about exploitation and the commodification of the human body.

The ethical and societal issues surrounding organ and blood donation are multifaceted and constantly evolving. There are no simple solutions, and open and honest dialogue is essential for navigating these complex challenges. By fostering a greater understanding of the ethical principles involved and addressing the cultural and societal barriers, we can work towards a future where the gift of life is available to all who need it.

**SECTION 2**

Good evening, everyone. My name is John Carter, and I'm from the Community Health Initiative. I'm here tonight to talk to you about a topic that is incredibly important, but one that many of us find difficult to discuss: organ donation. My aim is to give you some information about what organ donation involves and to encourage you to think about becoming a donor.

So, what is organ donation? It is the process of giving an organ to someone else who needs a transplant. This can happen after a person has died, or in some cases, a living person can donate an organ. The reality is that there is a desperate shortage of organ donors. In this country alone, there are thousands of people on the waiting list for a transplant, and sadly, some of them will die before an organ becomes available. This is the biggest challenge we face.

One of the most amazing things about organ donation is the impact it can have. A single organ donor can save up to eight lives. That's eight people who are given a second chance, eight families who are spared the heartbreak of losing a loved one. And it's not just organs that can be donated. Tissue donation, such as skin, bone, and heart valves, can also dramatically improve the quality of life for many people.

If you are considering becoming an organ donor, the first and most important step is to register your decision. You can do this online, and it only takes a few minutes. It's also crucial to talk to your family about your wishes. This can be a difficult conversation, but it's so important to ensure that your decision is respected.

Now, I'd like to talk a little about some of the specific organs that can be donated. The heart, of course, is a vital organ, and a heart transplant can be a life-saving procedure for someone with severe heart failure. It is often seen as a symbol of love and life. The kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs, and it is possible for a living person to donate a kidney. This is a remarkable act of generosity. The liver is another organ that can be donated by a living donor, as it has the amazing ability to regenerate. A portion of the liver can be transplanted, and both the donor's and the recipient's liver will grow back to full size. The lungs are essential for breathing, and a lung transplant can be a lifeline for someone with a serious respiratory disease. Finally, the pancreas can be transplanted to help people with type 1 diabetes, as it can restore the body's ability to produce insulin.

I hope this has given you a better understanding of organ donation. It is a truly life-changing gift, and I urge you to consider becoming a donor. Thank you for listening.

**SECTION 3**

**David:** Hi Maria. How did you find the lecture on the ethics of organ donation?

**Maria:** Hi David. It was really interesting, wasn't it? It gave me a lot to think about.

**David:** Me too. I was particularly struck by the discussion on the definition of "brain death".

**Maria:** Yes, that was a real eye-opener. I hadn't realized that it was such a controversial topic. I always assumed it was a clear-cut medical diagnosis.

**David:** Exactly. And the way the lecturer linked it to cultural and religious beliefs was fascinating. It really highlighted the complexity of the issue.

**Maria:** It did. And it made me think about the whole process of organ allocation. It must be incredibly difficult to decide who gets a transplant when there are so many people on the waiting list.

**David:** I agree. The lecturer mentioned the ethical principles they use, like medical urgency and the likelihood of success, but it still seems like a huge responsibility.

**Maria:** It is. And what about the issue of informed consent? That's another area that's full of ethical dilemmas.

**David:** Yes, especially when it comes to deceased donors. The idea of a family overriding a person's registered wish to be a donor is a difficult one.

**Maria:** I think the media has a lot to answer for in that respect. They often focus on the sensational stories, which can create fear and mistrust.

**David:** That's a good point. Public perception is so important. If people don't trust the system, they won't be willing to donate.

**Maria:** So, what do you think about the idea of a market for organs? The lecturer seemed to be against it.

**David:** I am too. I think it would lead to the exploitation of the poor and vulnerable. It would turn the human body into a commodity.

**Maria:** I agree. It's a scary thought. I think a better solution is to move towards an "opt-out" system, where everyone is considered a donor unless they specifically choose not to be.

**David:** That's an interesting idea. It's been successful in other countries, hasn't it?

**Maria:** Yes, it has. It's definitely something to consider. So, for our presentation, should we focus on the ethical challenges of organ donation?

**David:** I think so. There's certainly enough material. We could call it "The Price of Life: Ethical Dilemmas".

**Maria:** I like that. It's catchy. Let's start planning it out.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the future of transplantation. As we've discussed in previous lectures, the field of transplantation is constantly **evolving**. Today, I want to focus on two of the most exciting and promising areas of research: xenotransplantation and the development of **artificial** organs.

Let's start with xenotransplantation. This is the transplantation of organs from animals to humans. The main animal that is being researched for this purpose is the **pig**. Pigs are a good choice because their organs are a similar size to human organs, and they are relatively easy to breed. However, there are two major challenges that need to be overcome. The first is organ **rejection**. The human immune system is designed to attack foreign tissue, and it will quickly reject an animal organ. The second challenge is the risk of transmitting animal **diseases** to humans. This is a serious concern, and scientists are working hard to find ways to minimize this risk.

Despite these challenges, there have been some recent breakthroughs in the field. Scientists have been able to use genetic engineering to modify pigs to make their organs more compatible with the human body. And just last year, in a world first, surgeons successfully transplanted a pig's **kidney** into a human patient. This was a major milestone, and it has given hope to the thousands of people on the transplant waiting list.

Now, let's turn to the development of artificial organs. These are man-made devices that are designed to replace the function of a failing organ. We already have artificial hearts, which are used to keep patients alive while they wait for a heart transplant. And there are also ventricular **assist** devices, which can help a weakened heart to pump blood more effectively.

The main advantage of artificial organs is that there is no risk of rejection. They can also be produced on **demand**, which would eliminate the need for a waiting list. However, there are also some significant disadvantages. Artificial organs are very expensive, and they have a limited **lifespan**. They also require the patient to take medication to prevent blood clots.

In conclusion, the future of transplantation is very **promising**. Xenotransplantation and artificial organs are two of the most exciting areas of research, and they have the potential to revolutionize the field. While there are still many challenges to overcome, these new technologies could one day provide a solution to the chronic shortage of donor organs. Now, are there any questions?

## TUTOR GUIDE

**MODEL ANSWER FOR WRITING TASK 1**

The bar chart illustrates the rates of deceased organ donation in a selection of countries for the year 2022, measured in donors per million people.

Overall, Spain had the highest rate of organ donation, while Germany had the lowest among the countries shown. The United States also had a significantly high rate, comparable to that of Spain.

Spain led the world in organ donation with 47 deceased donors per million people. The United States followed closely behind with a rate of 44.5 per million. This figure is particularly noteworthy given the country's opt-in system for donation. Other countries with relatively high donation rates included Croatia and Portugal, with 35.5 and 33.7 donors per million, respectively.

In contrast, the rates of organ donation in the United Kingdom and Germany were considerably lower. The United Kingdom had a rate of 20.7 donors per million people, which is less than half the rate of Spain. Germany's rate was even lower, at just 10.3 donors per million, making it the country with the fewest organ donors in this group.

**MODEL ESSAY FOR WRITING TASK 2 (BAND 9 LEVEL)**

The debate over mandatory organ donation is a complex one, balancing the potential to save lives against the principle of individual autonomy. While the idea of an "opt-out" system, where all citizens are presumed to be donors unless they explicitly state otherwise, is gaining traction, there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue.

Proponents of a mandatory system argue that it would significantly increase the supply of organs for transplantation, thereby saving thousands of lives each year. They contend that the societal benefit of saving lives outweighs the individual's right to bodily autonomy after death. In countries that have adopted an opt-out system, such as Spain and Belgium, organ donation rates have indeed increased substantially. This suggests that such a policy could be highly effective in addressing the chronic shortage of organs. Furthermore, it can be argued that donation is a civic duty, a final act of service to the community.

On the other hand, opponents of a mandatory system raise serious ethical concerns about individual freedom and the role of the state. They argue that the human body should not be considered a national resource, and that individuals have the right to decide what happens to their bodies after they die. Forcing people to donate their organs, even passively through an opt-out system, could be seen as a violation of this fundamental right. There are also concerns that such a system could erode trust in the medical profession, with some people fearing that doctors might not do everything possible to save their lives if they are a potential organ donor.

In my opinion, while the intention behind a mandatory organ donation system is laudable, it is a step too far in infringing upon individual liberty. A person's body is their own, and the decision to donate their organs should be a conscious and voluntary act of generosity. A better approach would be to focus on education and awareness campaigns to encourage more people to become donors. By dispelling myths, addressing fears, and highlighting the life-saving impact of donation, we can foster a culture where donation is the norm, rather than the exception. This, combined with making the process of registration as easy as possible, would be a more ethical and ultimately more effective way to increase the number of organ donors.

**SPEAKING PART 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE**

I'd like to talk about a time I helped a friend who was going through a difficult period. My friend, let's call her Anna, had just lost her job, and she was feeling very down and anxious about the future. I knew I had to do something to support her.

I helped her in a few different ways. Firstly, I just listened. I let her talk about her fears and frustrations without judging or offering unsolicited advice. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a huge difference. I also helped her to update her CV and search for new job opportunities. We spent a few afternoons together, scouring job websites and tailoring her applications. It was a practical way to help her feel more in control of the situation.

I decided to help her because she's a close friend, and I couldn't bear to see her so unhappy. I knew that if I were in her position, I would want someone to be there for me. It's what friends do for each other. I also believe that we have a responsibility to help others when we can, no matter how small the gesture.

After helping her, I felt a sense of satisfaction and warmth. It was rewarding to know that I had made a positive difference in her life, even in a small way. It also strengthened our friendship. She eventually found a new job, and she told me that my support had been a great help to her during that difficult time. It reminded me that kindness and compassion are two of the most important qualities we can possess.
