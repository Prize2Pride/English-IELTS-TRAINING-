### READING PASSAGE 1

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Psychology of a Wager**

The allure of gambling has captivated humanity for centuries, from ancient bone games to the glittering casinos of Las Vegas and the virtual betting world of the internet. While for many, gambling is a harmless recreational activity, for a significant minority, it can spiral into a devastating addiction. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of gambling addiction is crucial for addressing this growing public health concern. At its core, gambling addiction, or gambling disorder, is a behavioral addiction characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble despite negative consequences. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) reclassified it from an impulse-control disorder to an addictive disorder, placing it in the same category as substance abuse.

This reclassification reflects the growing body of evidence that gambling affects the brain in a manner remarkably similar to addictive drugs. The brain's reward system, a network of neural pathways responsible for pleasure and motivation, is central to this process. When a person engages in a potentially rewarding activity, such as eating a delicious meal or, in this case, placing a bet, the brain releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This dopamine surge creates a feeling of pleasure and reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to be repeated. In individuals with a gambling addiction, this system becomes hijacked. The anticipation of a win, and the occasional actual win, can trigger a dopamine release far more powerful than that experienced by casual gamblers. This intense neurological response creates a powerful craving that can override rational decision-making.

Several psychological factors contribute to the development and maintenance of gambling addiction. One of the most significant is the concept of 'variable ratio reinforcement'. Unlike activities where the reward is predictable, gambling offers intermittent and unpredictable rewards. This pattern of reinforcement is notoriously effective at establishing and maintaining behavior. The gambler never knows which bet will be the winning one, and this uncertainty keeps them hooked. The 'near miss' phenomenon, where a gambler comes close to winning but ultimately loses, is another powerful psychological driver. These near misses are often interpreted not as losses, but as signs that a win is imminent, further encouraging the individual to continue gambling.

Cognitive distortions, or irrational ways of thinking, are also a hallmark of gambling addiction. Many problem gamblers hold erroneous beliefs about their chances of winning. They may believe they have a special skill or knowledge that gives them an edge, or that they can control the outcome of a game of chance. This 'illusion of control' can lead to excessive risk-taking and a failure to recognize the true odds of the game. Another common distortion is 'gambler's fallacy', the belief that a particular outcome is 'due' after a series of other outcomes. For example, a gambler might believe that after a string of losses on a slot machine, a win is inevitable. These cognitive distortions prevent the gambler from seeing the reality of their situation and perpetuate the cycle of addiction.

Certain individuals are more vulnerable to developing a gambling addiction than others. Genetic predisposition appears to play a role, with studies suggesting that a significant portion of the risk for gambling disorder is inherited. Co-occurring mental health conditions are also a major risk factor. Individuals with depression, anxiety, or substance abuse disorders are more likely to develop a gambling problem, often using gambling as a way to escape from their emotional pain. Personality traits such as impulsivity, competitiveness, and a tendency towards boredom can also increase a person's susceptibility. The social and environmental context is also critical. Easy access to gambling venues, whether physical or online, and the normalization of gambling within a person's social circle can significantly increase the risk of developing a problem.

In conclusion, gambling addiction is a complex disorder with deep psychological and neurological roots. The brain's reward system, powerful reinforcement schedules, cognitive distortions, and individual vulnerabilities all contribute to the development and maintenance of this destructive behavior. A comprehensive understanding of these factors is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to help those who have fallen prey to the psychology of the wager.

### READING PASSAGE 2

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Socio-Economic Ripple Effect of Problem Gambling**

**A.** The dazzling lights and thrilling sounds of a casino floor can be intoxicating, promising instant wealth and a temporary escape from the mundane. However, beneath this glamorous facade lies a darker reality: the pervasive and often devastating socio-economic consequences of problem gambling. While the individual gambler bears the most immediate burden, the ripple effect of their addiction extends far beyond them, touching families, communities, and even national economies. The financial strain caused by problem gambling is often the most visible consequence. Individuals may deplete their savings, accumulate massive debts, and even resort to illegal activities such as theft or fraud to fund their habit. This can lead to bankruptcy, home foreclosure, and a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break.

**B.** The impact on the family unit is equally profound. Spouses and children of problem gamblers often experience significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and anger. The constant financial pressure and the gambler's preoccupation with their addiction can lead to marital breakdown and domestic conflict. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to the negative effects of a parent's gambling problem. They may suffer from neglect, emotional trauma, and an increased likelihood of developing their own addictive behaviors later in life. The breakdown of trust and communication within the family can have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences.

**C.** Beyond the immediate family, the wider community also feels the impact of problem gambling. Increased crime rates are a common consequence, as some problem gamblers turn to illegal activities to support their addiction. This places a greater burden on law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Local businesses can also suffer, as money that could have been spent on goods and services is instead lost to gambling. In some cases, the presence of a large casino in a community can lead to a decline in other forms of entertainment and a hollowing out of the local economy.

**D.** The economic arguments in favor of legalized gambling often center on the jobs and tax revenue it can generate. Proponents argue that casinos and other gambling establishments create employment opportunities and contribute significantly to government coffers. However, a closer examination reveals a more complex picture. The jobs created by the gambling industry are often low-wage and precarious, with high turnover rates. Furthermore, the social costs associated with problem gambling, such as increased healthcare and criminal justice expenses, can offset the tax revenue generated. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is needed to determine the true economic impact of gambling on a community.

**E.** The debate over the economic impact of gambling is further complicated by the issue of 'cannibalization'. This refers to the phenomenon where a new gambling venue, such as a casino, does not generate new economic activity but simply diverts spending from other local businesses. For example, instead of going out to a restaurant or a movie, people may choose to spend their disposable income at the casino. This can lead to a decline in revenue for other businesses in the community, and a net loss of economic activity. The promise of economic revitalization through gambling can therefore be a double-edged sword.

**F.** In response to the growing awareness of the social and economic costs of problem gambling, many governments and organizations have implemented responsible gambling initiatives. These programs aim to educate the public about the risks of gambling, provide resources for those who are struggling with addiction, and promote a safer gambling environment. Self-exclusion programs, which allow individuals to voluntarily ban themselves from gambling venues, are one example of such an initiative. While the effectiveness of these programs is still being debated, they represent an important step towards mitigating the negative consequences of problem gambling.

### READING PASSAGE 3

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**Breaking the Cycle: Treatment and Prevention of Gambling Addiction**

The journey from problem gambler to recovery is a challenging one, but with the right support and interventions, it is possible to break free from the grip of addiction. A multifaceted approach that addresses the psychological, social, and biological aspects of the disorder is essential for long-term success. Treatment for gambling addiction typically involves a combination of therapy, medication, and support groups, tailored to the individual needs of the person seeking help.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective and widely used therapeutic approaches for treating gambling addiction. CBT helps individuals to identify and challenge the irrational thoughts and beliefs that fuel their gambling behavior. For example, a therapist might help a client to recognize the gambler's fallacy and the illusion of control, and to develop more realistic and adaptive ways of thinking. Behavioral techniques, such as stimulus control and response prevention, are also used to help individuals to avoid triggers and to develop coping mechanisms for dealing with cravings. By changing their thoughts and behaviors, individuals can gain a sense of control over their addiction.

Motivational Interviewing is another therapeutic technique that has shown promise in the treatment of gambling addiction. This client-centered approach aims to resolve ambivalence and to enhance intrinsic motivation for change. Rather than confronting the individual and telling them what to do, the therapist works collaboratively with them to explore their reasons for wanting to change and to build their confidence in their ability to do so. This can be particularly effective for individuals who are resistant to treatment or who are in the early stages of considering a change.

While there are no medications specifically approved for the treatment of gambling addiction, some have been found to be effective in reducing the urge to gamble. Opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, which are used to treat alcohol and opioid addiction, have been shown to reduce gambling cravings and to decrease the pleasurable effects of gambling. Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be helpful for individuals who have co-occurring depression or anxiety. However, medication is typically used in conjunction with therapy, rather than as a standalone treatment.

Support groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous (GA), can also play a crucial role in the recovery process. GA is a twelve-step program that provides a supportive and non-judgmental environment where individuals can share their experiences and learn from others who have faced similar challenges. The sense of community and shared purpose can be a powerful antidote to the isolation and shame that often accompany gambling addiction. While the twelve-step model is not for everyone, many people find it to be an invaluable source of support and encouragement.

Preventing the development of gambling addiction is just as important as treating it. Public health campaigns that raise awareness of the risks of gambling and that promote responsible gambling practices are an essential component of any prevention strategy. School-based programs that educate young people about the dangers of gambling and that teach them critical thinking skills can also be effective. Furthermore, the regulation of the gambling industry is crucial. Measures such as restricting the accessibility of gambling venues, limiting the advertising of gambling products, and implementing responsible gambling features on electronic gaming machines can all help to create a safer gambling environment.

In conclusion, a comprehensive and individualized approach is needed to address the complex problem of gambling addiction. By combining evidence-based therapies, such as CBT and motivational interviewing, with medication and support groups, it is possible to help individuals to break the cycle of addiction and to rebuild their lives. At the same time, a strong focus on prevention, through public education and industry regulation, is essential for reducing the harm caused by problem gambling in our communities.

**Counselor:** I see. Can you tell me your husband's name?

**Sarah:** It's Mark. Mark **(1) Jones**.

**Counselor:** And can I just confirm the date today? It's the **(2) 18th of January**, 2026.

**Sarah:** Yes, that's right.

**Counselor:** Okay, Sarah. Tell me about Mark's situation. What makes you think he has a gambling problem?

**Sarah:** Well, it's been going on for a while now. I think for about **(4) two years**. He's always been secretive about his finances, but recently it's gotten much worse. He spends hours on his computer, and I know he's playing online poker and betting on **(5) sports**.

**Counselor:** And has this had a financial impact on your family?

**Sarah:** A huge one. I found a credit card statement the other day, and he's in debt for over **(6) £10,000**. I don't know how we're going to pay it back.

**Counselor:** I understand this must be a very difficult and stressful situation for you. Have you noticed any other changes in his behavior?

**Sarah:** Yes, he's become very irritable and withdrawn. He's lost all **(7) interest** in his hobbies and spending time with me and the children. It's like he's a different person.

**Counselor:** It sounds like Mark is displaying many of the classic signs of a gambling addiction. The good news is that there is help available. I would strongly recommend that he attends a **(8) Gamblers Anonymous** meeting. It's a support group for people with gambling problems, and it can be very effective.

**Sarah:** Okay, I'll talk to him about it. Where can we find a meeting?

**Counselor:** There's a meeting every Tuesday evening at the **(9) Community** Centre on the High Street. It's a very welcoming and supportive environment.

**Sarah:** Thank you, that's really helpful. Is there a number I can call for more information?

**Counselor:** Yes, the national helpline number is **(10) 0808 8020 133**. They can provide you with more information and support.

**Sarah:** Thank you so much, David. I really appreciate your help.

**Counselor:** You're welcome, Sarah. Please don't hesitate to call back if you need to talk again.

### SECTION 2

**(Sound of a person clearing their throat)**

**Speaker:** Good morning, everyone. My name is Dr. Emily Carter, and I'm a psychologist specializing in addiction. Today, I want to talk to you about a growing problem in our society: gambling addiction. Specifically, I want to focus on the warning signs that can help you to identify if you or someone you know might have a problem.

One of the earliest and most common signs of a gambling problem is spending more time and money on gambling than you originally intended. You might find yourself chasing your losses, which means you continue to gamble in an attempt to win back the money you've lost. This can quickly spiral into a cycle of debt and despair.

Another key warning sign is lying about your gambling. You might hide your losses from your family and friends, or you might make excuses for the amount of time you spend gambling. This secrecy is a clear indication that you know your behavior is problematic.

Gambling addiction doesn't just affect your finances; it can also have a serious impact on your mental and emotional well-being. You might experience feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety. You might become irritable and withdrawn, and you might lose interest in activities you once enjoyed. In severe cases, gambling addiction can even lead to depression and suicidal thoughts.

It's important to remember that gambling addiction can affect anyone, regardless of their age, gender, or background. However, some groups are more vulnerable than others. Teenagers, for example, are at a higher risk of developing a gambling problem, often because they are introduced to it through video games that have gambling-like features. University students are also a high-risk group, as they often have more free time and easy access to online gambling sites.

In terms of gender, men are more likely to be drawn to strategic forms of gambling, such as poker and sports betting, while women are more likely to develop a gambling problem quickly, often through non-strategic forms like slot machines. Older adults may also be at risk, as they may turn to gambling to cope with loneliness or boredom.

If you recognize any of these warning signs in yourself or someone you know, it's crucial to seek professional help. There are many resources available, including therapy, support groups, and helplines. Remember, you don't have to go through this alone.

### SECTION 3

**Tutor:** Okay, so for your presentation next week, you've decided to focus on the causes and treatment of gambling addiction. That's a great topic. How are you planning to structure it?

**Chloe:** Well, we were thinking of starting with the neurological causes, specifically the role of dopamine. We've read that the brain's reward system is hijacked in gambling addiction, and the release of dopamine creates a powerful craving for the activity.

**Mark:** Yes, and we want to emphasize that it's not just about a lack of willpower. There are real biological factors at play. We also want to talk about cognitive distortions, like the gambler's fallacy and the illusion of control. We think it's important to explain how these irrational beliefs can perpetuate the addiction.

**Tutor:** That sounds like a good start. What about the social and environmental factors?

**Chloe:** We're definitely going to include that. We've found some interesting research on how a person's social environment, like having friends or family who gamble, can be a major contributing factor to developing a problem.

**Tutor:** Excellent. So, you've covered the causes. What about the treatment?

**Mark:** We're planning to discuss a few different approaches. We'll start with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, as it seems to be one of the most effective treatments. We'll explain how it helps people to identify and change their irrational thoughts and behaviors.

**Chloe:** We also want to talk about motivational interviewing and how it can help people who are resistant to change. And we'll touch on the role of medication. We've read that while there's no cure for gambling addiction, some medications can be a helpful tool when combined with therapy.

**Tutor:** That's a comprehensive overview. Do you agree on the effectiveness of all these treatments?

**Mark:** For the most part, yes. But we have slightly different views on the effectiveness of support groups like Gamblers Anonymous. I think they can be incredibly helpful, but Chloe is a bit more skeptical.

**Chloe:** It's not that I don't think they can be helpful. I just think it's important to acknowledge that the twelve-step model isn't for everyone. We want to present a balanced view.

**Tutor:** That's a fair point. It's good to show that you've considered different perspectives. And what about prevention?

**Mark:** We're going to finish with a section on prevention. We'll talk about the importance of public health campaigns and school-based education programs.

**Chloe:** And I think it's crucial to mention the need for stricter regulation of the gambling industry. I think that's the most important aspect of prevention.

**Tutor:** This all sounds very promising. My only suggestion would be to perhaps narrow your focus slightly. You have a lot of great information here, but you might struggle to fit it all into a ten-minute presentation. Perhaps you could focus on either the causes or the treatment in more detail?

**Mark:** That's a good idea. We'll have a think about that. Thanks for the feedback.

### SECTION 4

**(Sound of a lecturer speaking)**

**Lecturer:** Good morning. In today's lecture, we're going to delve into the fascinating and complex world of the neuroscience of gambling addiction. We'll be exploring how this behavioral addiction hijacks the brain and what that means for treatment and prevention.

So, let's start with the brain's reward system. This is a network of neural pathways that is responsible for processing pleasure and **(31) motivation**. When we engage in a rewarding activity, our brain releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This dopamine surge creates a sense of **(32) pleasure** and reinforces the behavior, making us more likely to repeat it.

In a healthy brain, this system is well-regulated. However, in the case of gambling addiction, the reward system becomes **(33) hijacked**. The intense and unpredictable nature of gambling can trigger a massive release of dopamine, far greater than what is experienced in response to natural rewards. This creates a powerful craving that can override a person's **(34) rational judgment**.

Over time, the brain adapts to these high levels of dopamine. It becomes less sensitive to the neurotransmitter, which means that the person needs to gamble more and more to achieve the same level of pleasure. This is known as tolerance. At the same time, the brain becomes less responsive to other, more natural rewards. Activities that were once enjoyable no longer provide the same level of satisfaction.

Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed that there are both structural and functional **(35) changes** in the brains of individuals with a gambling addiction. For example, there is often reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain that is crucial for **(36) decision-making** and impulse control. This can explain the impulsivity and poor decision-making that are characteristic of the disorder.

Furthermore, there are alterations in the brain's response to **(37) stress**. Many problem gamblers report that they gamble to escape from negative emotions, and there is evidence to suggest that their brains are wired to be more sensitive to stress and less able to cope with it in a healthy way.

Of course, neuroscience is not the whole story. Genetic predisposition is a significant factor, but **(38) environmental factors** are also crucial. Early exposure to gambling, for example, can increase a person's **(39) vulnerability** to developing a problem later in life. The complex interaction between our genes and our environment is a key area of ongoing **(40) research**.

By understanding the neuroscience of gambling addiction, we can develop more effective treatments and prevention strategies. For example, medications that target the dopamine system may be helpful in reducing cravings. And therapies that focus on improving decision-making and stress management skills can help to counteract the changes that have occurred in the brain. It is a challenging but ultimately hopeful field of study.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### MODEL ANSWER FOR WRITING TASK 1

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people in a specific country who reported having problems with gambling in 2022, broken down by age group.

Overall, the chart shows a clear inverse correlation between age and the prevalence of gambling problems. The youngest age group, 16-24, had the highest percentage of people with gambling problems, at 2.5%. This figure was significantly higher than that of any other age group.

The percentage of people with gambling problems steadily decreased with age. The 25-34 age group had the second-highest rate, at 1.8%, followed by the 35-44 age group, at 1.2%. The decline continued in the 45-54 and 55-64 age groups, with rates of 0.8% and 0.5% respectively.

The lowest percentage of people with gambling problems was found in the oldest age group, 65+, at just 0.2%. This is more than twelve times lower than the rate for the 16-24 age group. In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that young people in this country are disproportionately affected by gambling problems.

### MODEL ESSAY FOR WRITING TASK 2 (BAND 9 LEVEL)

The proliferation of legalized gambling has sparked a contentious debate. Proponents champion its economic virtues, citing job creation and substantial tax revenues. Conversely, opponents sound the alarm about the devastating social consequences of gambling addiction, arguing that they eclipse any fiscal benefits. This essay will examine both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

From an economic standpoint, the arguments in favor of legalized gambling are compelling. The construction and operation of casinos, for instance, can generate a significant number of jobs, ranging from construction workers to hospitality staff. These employment opportunities can be a lifeline for communities with high unemployment rates. Furthermore, the tax revenue generated from gambling activities can be a substantial boon to government budgets. These funds can be used to finance public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, thereby benefiting the wider community. The state of Nevada in the United States, with its world-renowned gambling hub of Las Vegas, is a prime example of an economy that is heavily reliant on the gambling industry.

However, the economic benefits of gambling are often overshadowed by its social costs. Gambling addiction is a serious public health issue that can have a devastating impact on individuals, families, and communities. Problem gamblers often accumulate massive debts, leading to bankruptcy, home foreclosure, and even criminal activity. The emotional toll on families can be immense, with increased rates of divorce, domestic conflict, and child neglect. Moreover, the social costs associated with problem gambling, such as increased healthcare and criminal justice expenses, can place a significant strain on public resources. These costs can, in some cases, outweigh the tax revenue generated by the industry.

In my opinion, while the economic benefits of gambling are undeniable, the social costs are far more significant and long-lasting. The pursuit of short-term financial gains should not come at the expense of the well-being of individuals and communities. It is incumbent upon governments to implement robust regulations to protect vulnerable individuals and to mitigate the harm caused by problem gambling. This should include stricter controls on advertising, the provision of comprehensive treatment and support services, and public education campaigns to raise awareness of the risks. Ultimately, a society should be judged not by the size of its economy, but by the well-being of its citizens.

### SPEAKING PART 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE

I'd like to talk about a time when I took a risk by deciding to move to a new country for my university studies. It was a huge step for me, as I had never lived away from home before, let alone in a different country with a different culture and language. I was both excited and terrified at the same time.

The main reason I took this risk was for my personal and academic growth. I had always dreamed of studying abroad and immersing myself in a new environment. I knew that it would be a challenging experience, but I also believed that it would be incredibly rewarding. I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone and to become more independent and resilient.

The result of taking this risk was that I had the most amazing and transformative experience of my life. I learned so much, not just academically, but also about myself and the world. I made friends from all over the globe, and I became fluent in a new language. It wasn't always easy, of course. There were times when I felt homesick and overwhelmed, but I persevered, and I'm so glad I did.

Looking back, I feel incredibly proud of myself for taking that risk. It was a leap of faith, but it paid off in more ways than I could have ever imagined. The experience taught me that it's important to take calculated risks in life, as that's how we grow and learn. It gave me the confidence to face new challenges and to embrace the unknown. It was a truly life-changing experience.
