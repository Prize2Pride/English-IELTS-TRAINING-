**The Ancient Greek Theatre: A Stage for Gods and Mortals**

The origins of theatre in ancient Greece can be traced back to the 6th century BCE, a time when religious festivals celebrating the god Dionysus were gaining widespread popularity. Central to these festivities were the dithyrambs, passionate choral hymns sung in praise of the god of wine and revelry. It is from these lyrical performances that theatre is believed to have emerged. One prevailing theory suggests that a pivotal moment occurred when a single performer, Thespis, stepped out from the chorus to enact the stories being sung, thus becoming the world’s first actor. By using different masks, Thespis was able to portray multiple characters, a groundbreaking innovation that laid the foundation for dramatic performance. In its nascent form, Greek theatre was a simple affair, featuring a single actor interacting with a chorus. However, over the next 150 years, the art form underwent a remarkable evolution, with the addition of more actors and the development of sophisticated architectural structures to house the performances.

The archetypal Greek theatre was a marvel of engineering and acoustics, designed to accommodate large audiences and ensure that every word and gesture was seen and heard. The most famous of these, the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, was an open-air amphitheater built into a hillside, a model that would be replicated across the Hellenic world. The seating area, or *theatron*, was arranged in semi-circular tiers, providing excellent sightlines for all spectators. At the heart of the theatre was the *orchestra*, a circular space where the chorus would sing and dance. In the center of the orchestra stood the *thymele*, a small altar that sometimes served as a focal point for the performance. The stage, or *proskenion*, was a raised platform where the actors performed, and behind it was the *skene*, a building that served as a backdrop, a changing room, and a place for storing props. Actors could make dramatic entrances and exits through the *parodoi*, the passageways on either side of the stage. A particularly spectacular effect was the *deus ex machina*, or “god from the machine,” a crane-like device used to lower an actor playing a deity onto the stage, providing a divine resolution to the dramatic conflict.

The chorus was an integral part of Greek theatre, serving a multitude of functions. It acted as a narrator, providing background information and context for the audience. It also served as a commentator on the action, offering a collective perspective on the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. The chorus could express the fears and hopes of the community, and its odes, or choral songs, provided a lyrical counterpoint to the dramatic dialogue. The chorus leader, or *coryphaeus*, sometimes engaged in dialogue with the actors, further blurring the line between commentary and action.

The golden age of Greek theatre, in the 5th century BCE, was dominated by three great tragedians: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Aeschylus, the earliest of the three, is credited with adding a second actor, which allowed for true dialogue and dramatic conflict. His plays, such as the *Oresteia* trilogy, are characterized by their grand themes and majestic language. Sophocles, often regarded as the greatest of the Greek playwrights, introduced a third actor and reduced the importance of the chorus in favor of more developed characters and intricate plots. His most famous works, including *Oedipus Rex* and *Antigone*, explore the depths of human suffering and the nature of fate. Euripides, the last of the great tragedians, was a more radical and experimental playwright. He delved into the psychology of his characters, often portraying them as flawed and conflicted individuals. His plays, such as *Medea* and *The Bacchae*, challenged traditional values and explored the darker aspects of human nature. The works of these three playwrights not only defined Greek tragedy but also laid the groundwork for the entire tradition of Western drama, a legacy that continues to resonate in theatres around the world today.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Grand Spectacle: A History of the Circus**

**A.** The circus, a travelling company of performers that has captivated audiences for centuries, is a unique art form that blends spectacle, skill, and a touch of danger. While many associate the circus with the red-and-white striped big top tent, its origins can be traced back to ancient Rome. The Roman ‘circus’ was a grand open-air venue, the most famous of which was the Circus Maximus, a colossal structure that could hold up to 250,000 spectators. Here, the public would gather to watch thrilling chariot races, gladiatorial contests, and displays of exotic animals. Notably, the Roman circus was a rare instance of a public gathering where men and women were not segregated, making it a unique social space in the ancient world.

**B.** The modern circus, as we know it, was born in 18th-century England, thanks to the vision of Philip Astley, a former cavalry officer. In 1768, Astley opened an amphitheater in London to showcase his equestrian skills. While trick riding was not a new phenomenon, Astley was the first to create a dedicated circular arena for such performances, which he called a ‘Circle’. This circular shape was ideal for horse-based acts, as it allowed the riders to use centrifugal force to their advantage. The name ‘circus’ soon became synonymous with this new form of entertainment. Astley’s success was followed by others, including his former rider Charles Hughes, who, with his partner Charles Dibdin, opened The Royal Circus in London in 1782. The art of clowning also began to take shape during this period, with Joseph Grimaldi’s portrayal of ‘Little Clown’ in the late 18th century establishing many of the character tropes that are still associated with clowns today.

**C.** The circus soon crossed the Atlantic, with John Bill Ricketts establishing the first modern circus in the United States in Philadelphia in 1793. The 19th century saw the circus evolve from a stationary performance in a dedicated building to a travelling show. This transition was made possible by the invention of the circus tent, or ‘big top’. Joshuah Purdy Brown is credited with being the first to use a large tent for his circus in 1825, a practice that was later introduced to England by Thomas Taplin Cooke in 1838. The portability of the tent allowed circuses to reach a wider audience, travelling from town to town and bringing their unique brand of entertainment to people across the country. The iconic red-and-white striped design of the big top, however, did not become commonplace until later in the 19th century.

**D.** The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked the golden age of the travelling circus, with shows like “The Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth” becoming household names. These circuses were grand affairs, featuring a wide array of acts designed to thrill and amaze. Traditional circus acts included acrobats, who performed daring feats of strength and agility; trapeze artists, who soared through the air with breathtaking grace; and contortionists, who twisted their bodies into seemingly impossible shapes. Animal acts were also a major draw, with trained elephants, lions, and tigers performing incredible tricks. The sideshow, with its cast of ‘freaks’ and human oddities, was another popular, albeit controversial, element of the traditional circus.

**E.** The mid-20th century saw a decline in the popularity of the traditional circus, as audiences’ tastes began to change and concerns grew over the ethical treatment of animals. However, the circus was to be reinvented in the 1970s with the emergence of the ‘contemporary circus’ or ‘nouveau cirque’. This new form of circus, which originated in places like Australia, Canada, and France, moved away from the traditional three-ring format and the reliance on animal acts. Instead, it focused on storytelling and theatricality, combining traditional circus skills with dance, music, and character-driven narratives.

**F.** Perhaps the most famous example of the contemporary circus is Cirque du Soleil. Founded in Quebec, Canada, in 1984 by a group of street performers, Cirque du Soleil has become a global phenomenon. Its shows are known for their stunning visuals, imaginative storytelling, and the incredible skill of their performers. Cirque du Soleil has redefined the circus for a modern audience, creating a new kind of spectacle that is both artistically ambitious and commercially successful. Other notable contemporary circuses include the Pickle Family Circus in San Francisco and Circus Oz in Australia, both of which have contributed to the evolution of this ever-changing art form.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

_The following is an extract from a book about the history of popular culture._

**From Ancient Ritual to Modern Rave: The Story of the Music Festival**

The desire to gather and celebrate through music is a fundamental part of the human experience, and the history of the music festival is a testament to this enduring impulse. While the colossal, multi-day events we know today are a relatively recent phenomenon, the tradition of musical gatherings stretches back to antiquity. The earliest known precursor to the modern music festival was the Pythian Games, held in Delphi, ancient Greece, from the late 6th century BCE. These games, celebrated in honour of the god Apollo, were not solely athletic contests; they also featured a day of musical competitions, where musicians would vie for prizes and prestige. This fusion of music, competition, and communal celebration set a precedent that would echo through the centuries.

Another early example of a music festival can be found in the Welsh Eisteddfod, a celebration of Welsh culture that dates back to 1176. The first Eisteddfod, held at Cardigan Castle by Lord Rhys, was a grand competition for poets and musicians. After a period of decline, the tradition was revived in the 18th century and continues to this day, serving as a vibrant showcase of Welsh language and artistic expression. In the realm of classical music, the Three Choirs Festival in England, which began in the early 18th century, holds the distinction of being the oldest non-competitive classical music festival in the world. Centred around the cathedral choirs of Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester, the festival has been a cornerstone of British musical life for over 300 years.

The 20th century saw the birth of the modern rock festival, a cultural phenomenon that would come to define a generation. While the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967 is often cited as the first major rock festival, a smaller but equally significant event, the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival, took place a week earlier in California. However, it was the Woodstock Music and Art Fair of 1969 that truly cemented the music festival in the popular imagination. Held on a dairy farm in Bethel, New York, Woodstock was a chaotic, rain-soaked, and ultimately legendary event that attracted an estimated 400,000 people. Billed as “three days of peace and music,” the festival became a symbol of the counter-culture movement of the 1960s, a testament to the power of music to unite and inspire.

The legacy of Woodstock can be seen in the proliferation of music festivals that followed. In the United Kingdom, the Glastonbury Festival, which began in 1970, has grown from a small gathering of 1,500 people to one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world. The first Glastonbury, held the day after the death of Jimi Hendrix, featured performances by Marc Bolan and Al Stewart, and the price of admission included free milk from the organiser’s farm. Today, Glastonbury is a sprawling metropolis of music, art, and culture, attracting hundreds of thousands of people from all over the globe.

From the ancient Pythian Games to the sprawling fields of Glastonbury, the music festival has evolved from a simple gathering to a complex cultural phenomenon. It is a space where music, community, and commerce intersect, a place where people can escape the everyday and immerse themselves in a world of sound and spectacle. While the scale and style of music festivals may have changed over the centuries, the fundamental human need for communal celebration remains as strong as ever.

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people in various age groups who attended a live theatre performance in the last year. Overall, the data indicates that theatre attendance is most popular among the youngest and oldest age groups, while the middle age groups show a lower level of engagement.

The highest proportion of theatre-goers is in the 65+ age group, with 50% having attended a performance in the last year. This is closely followed by the 16-24 age group, at 45%. The 55-64 age group also shows a relatively high level of attendance, at 40%.

In contrast, the middle age groups show a significantly lower rate of theatre attendance. The 35-44 age group has the lowest percentage, at just 30%. The 25-34 and 45-54 age groups are slightly higher, at 35% and 25% respectively. This suggests that people in the middle stages of their lives may have less time or inclination for attending live theatre, perhaps due to work or family commitments.

In summary, the chart reveals a clear U-shaped pattern in theatre attendance, with the youngest and oldest generations being the most likely to have attended a live performance in the last year.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The proliferation of online streaming services has undeniably transformed the landscape of home entertainment, leading some to predict the demise of live performances such as theatre and concerts. However, I firmly believe that the unique and irreplaceable nature of the live experience will ensure its continued popularity for the foreseeable future.

On the one hand, it is understandable why some people believe that online streaming services pose a significant threat to live entertainment. The convenience and affordability of platforms like Netflix and Spotify are undeniable. For a relatively low monthly fee, subscribers have access to a vast library of films, television shows, and music, all available on demand. This can be particularly appealing to those with busy schedules or limited budgets, for whom a trip to the theatre or a concert may be a rare and expensive treat. Furthermore, the quality of home entertainment systems has improved dramatically in recent years, with large-screen televisions and surround sound systems creating a more immersive viewing experience.

On the other hand, despite the convenience of streaming services, they cannot replicate the unique atmosphere and emotional connection of a live performance. There is a certain magic in being part of an audience, sharing a collective experience with hundreds or even thousands of other people. The energy and excitement of a live concert, the raw emotion of a theatrical performance, the sense of community and shared humanity – these are things that simply cannot be downloaded or streamed. Moreover, live entertainment is an interactive experience. The performers feed off the energy of the audience, and every performance is a unique and unrepeatable event. This sense of immediacy and spontaneity is something that a recorded performance can never capture.

In my opinion, while online streaming services have certainly changed the way we consume media, they will never completely replace the need for live entertainment. The two forms of entertainment can, and do, coexist. In fact, in some cases, streaming services may even serve as a gateway to live performance, introducing new audiences to artists and productions they might not otherwise have discovered. Ultimately, the human desire for communal experience and authentic connection will ensure that live entertainment continues to thrive in the digital age.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

I’d like to talk about a concert I went to a few years ago that was a truly memorable experience. It was a performance by the British band, Coldplay, at Wembley Stadium in London. I went with my best friend, who is also a huge fan of the band. We had been looking forward to the concert for months, and it definitely lived up to our expectations.

The atmosphere in the stadium was absolutely electric. There were about 90,000 people there, all singing along to every song. The band was incredible, and they played all of their biggest hits. The stage show was also spectacular, with amazing lighting effects and pyrotechnics. At one point, they released thousands of giant, colourful balloons into the crowd, which was a really magical moment.

What made the concert so memorable for me was the sense of shared joy and unity. It was amazing to be part of such a huge crowd of people, all connected by their love of the music. For a few hours, all of our worries and problems seemed to disappear, and we were just lost in the moment. It was a really powerful and uplifting experience, and it’s something I will never forget.
