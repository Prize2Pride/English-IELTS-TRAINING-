### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**Reading Passage 1**

The economic debate surrounding drug legalization is a complex and multifaceted issue with compelling arguments on both sides. Proponents of legalization often highlight the potential for significant financial benefits, including increased tax revenue and reduced government expenditure on law enforcement. Conversely, opponents raise concerns about the potential for increased social costs, such as higher rates of addiction and associated healthcare expenses. A comprehensive examination of the economic landscape reveals a delicate balance between these competing considerations.

One of the most frequently cited arguments in favor of drug legalization is the potential for a substantial influx of tax revenue. By regulating and taxing the sale of drugs, governments could create a new stream of income that could be used to fund public services. For instance, a report from the Cato Institute projected that legalizing all illicit drugs could generate approximately $41.3 billion in annual tax revenue for the United States. This revenue could be allocated to education, infrastructure, or public health initiatives, thereby turning a previously illicit market into a productive component of the economy. Furthermore, the creation of a legal drug industry would lead to job growth in cultivation, processing, distribution, and retail, further stimulating economic activity.

In addition to generating revenue, legalization could also lead to significant savings in government expenditure. A substantial portion of law enforcement budgets is currently dedicated to combating the illegal drug trade. The costs associated with policing, court proceedings, and incarceration for drug-related offenses are immense. The Cato Institute report also estimated that legalization could reduce government spending by approximately $41.3 billion annually, with $25.7 billion of that savings coming from state and local governments and $15.6 billion from the federal government. These funds could be redirected to other priorities, such as crime prevention or rehabilitation programs.

However, the economic case for legalization is not without its counterarguments. Opponents often point to the potential for increased social costs that could offset any financial gains. A primary concern is the risk of a surge in drug addiction. If drugs become more readily available and socially acceptable, it is plausible that rates of use and dependency will rise. The Office of Justice Programs has suggested that drug legalization could lead to a 25 percent increase in the number of drug addicts. This would, in turn, place a greater strain on healthcare systems, with increased demand for addiction treatment and mental health services. The costs associated with treating addiction, as well as the lost productivity from an impaired workforce, could be substantial.

Furthermore, there is the question of how a legal drug market would be regulated. To be effective, a regulatory framework would need to be established to control the potency, purity, and marketing of drugs. This would require a new government bureaucracy, which would have its own associated costs. Additionally, there is the risk that a legal market would not entirely eliminate the black market. If taxes on legal drugs are too high, or if regulations are too stringent, an illicit market could continue to thrive, thereby undermining the potential for tax revenue and continued law enforcement challenges.

In conclusion, the economic arguments surrounding drug legalization are complex and nuanced. While the potential for increased tax revenue and reduced law enforcement costs is a powerful incentive, the potential for increased social costs, such as higher rates of addiction and the need for a new regulatory apparatus, cannot be ignored. A successful transition to a legalized drug market would require a carefully crafted policy that balances the potential for economic gain with the need to mitigate social harm. The debate is likely to continue as more jurisdictions around the world experiment with different models of drug policy, providing a richer body of evidence to inform future decisions.

*Write your answers in boxes 11-13 on your answer sheet.*

The economic implications of drug legalization are a subject of intense debate. Proponents argue that it could lead to significant financial benefits, such as increased 11. ____________ and reduced government spending. However, opponents worry about the potential for increased 12. ____________, such as a rise in addiction rates. A successful transition to a legalized market would require a 13. ____________ that balances economic gain with social harm.

**Reading Passage 2**

**A**
The social consequences of drug legalization are as hotly debated as the economic ones. Proponents argue that legalization can lead to a reduction in crime, a shift in focus from punishment to public health, and an increase in personal freedom. They contend that the current system of prohibition has created a dangerous and violent black market, and that by bringing the drug trade into the light, society can better control it. This perspective emphasizes the potential for a more just and equitable society, where resources are redirected from a failed war on drugs to education and treatment.

**B**
One of the most significant arguments in favor of legalization is the potential for a dramatic reduction in crime rates. The illegal drug trade is a major driver of crime, from low-level street dealing to large-scale organized crime. By making drugs legal, the argument goes, the black market would be dismantled, and the violence associated with it would decline. A study from the University of California, Irvine, found that the closure of medical marijuana dispensaries was associated with an increase in crime in the surrounding areas, suggesting that the presence of legal dispensaries can have a crime-reducing effect.

**C**
Furthermore, legalization allows for a shift in focus from a criminal justice approach to a public health approach. Instead of punishing drug users, the government can focus on providing education, prevention, and treatment. This approach recognizes that drug addiction is a medical issue, not a moral failing. Organizations like the Drug Policy Alliance advocate for a public health-centered approach, arguing that it is more effective and humane than the current system of criminalization. This shift could lead to better outcomes for individuals struggling with addiction and a more compassionate society as a whole.

**D**
However, opponents of legalization raise serious concerns about the potential for negative social consequences. A primary worry is that legalization will lead to an increase in drug use, particularly among young people. The normalization of drug use, they argue, could lead to a public health crisis. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has reported that in states that have legalized recreational marijuana, there has been an increase in marijuana use among young adults. This raises concerns about the potential for long-term health problems, including addiction and impaired cognitive development.

**E**
Another concern is the potential for an increase in drugged driving. If more people are using drugs, it is logical to assume that more people will be driving under the influence. This could lead to an increase in traffic accidents and fatalities. A study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that after the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon, collision claim frequencies were about 3% higher than would have been expected without legalization. This suggests that legalization could have a negative impact on public safety.

**F**
In conclusion, the social implications of drug legalization are complex and far-reaching. While the potential for reduced crime and a more public health-oriented approach is appealing, the risks of increased drug use and drugged driving cannot be ignored. As with the economic debate, the social debate is likely to continue as more data becomes available from jurisdictions that have chosen to legalize drugs. A successful policy will need to carefully balance the potential benefits of legalization with the need to protect public health and safety.

**Reading Passage 3**

The health implications of drug legalization are a critical component of the broader debate, encompassing a wide range of potential benefits and risks. Proponents argue that a regulated market can lead to improved public health outcomes through quality control, harm reduction strategies, and increased access to medical treatments. However, opponents voice significant concerns about the potential for a surge in addiction rates, a rise in mental health disorders, and other negative health consequences associated with increased drug use. A thorough analysis of the available evidence reveals a complex and often contradictory picture.

A key argument in favor of legalization from a public health perspective is the potential for improved product safety. In an illegal market, there is no oversight of drug production, leading to products that can be contaminated with dangerous substances or have unpredictable potency. A regulated market, by contrast, would allow for quality control measures, ensuring that consumers know what they are ingesting. This could significantly reduce the risk of accidental overdose and other adverse health events. Furthermore, legalization would facilitate the implementation of harm reduction strategies, such as providing clean needles and supervised consumption sites, which have been shown to reduce the spread of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C.

Another potential health benefit of legalization is the expansion of access to medical treatments. Many illicit drugs have therapeutic potential. For example, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with various medical conditions. Legalization would make it easier for patients to access these treatments under the guidance of a healthcare professional. It would also stimulate further research into the therapeutic applications of other currently illicit substances, potentially leading to new and innovative treatments for a range of diseases.

Despite these potential benefits, there are significant health risks associated with drug legalization that cannot be overlooked. A primary concern is the potential for an increase in addiction rates. The principles of supply and demand suggest that if drugs become cheaper, more available, and more socially acceptable, consumption will increase. This, in turn, could lead to a higher prevalence of substance use disorders. The public health consequences of a spike in addiction could be severe, placing a heavy burden on healthcare systems and leading to a wide range of social problems.

In addition to addiction, there are concerns about the potential for an increase in mental health disorders. There is a well-established link between the use of certain drugs, such as cannabis, and an increased risk of psychosis and other mental health problems, particularly in adolescents and young adults. If legalization leads to an increase in drug use among these vulnerable populations, it could result in a corresponding increase in the incidence of mental illness. This would have long-term consequences for the individuals affected, their families, and society as a whole.

Ultimately, the health effects of drug legalization are likely to be a mixed bag. While a regulated market could lead to improved product safety and expanded access to medical treatments, it could also result of a higher incidence of addiction and mental health disorders. The overall impact on public health will depend on the specific details of the regulatory framework that is put in place. A successful policy would need to include robust public health measures, such as comprehensive prevention and treatment programs, to mitigate the potential harms of increased drug use.

## LISTENING SCRIPTS

**Section 1**

**Sarah:** Hello everyone, and welcome to our community meeting. My name is Sarah, and I’m a teacher at the local primary school. I’ve called this meeting because I’m becoming increasingly concerned about the discussions around drug legalization. I’m particularly worried about the potential for a rise in crime. I’ve seen what drugs can do to a community, and I don’t want to see that happen here.

**David:** I understand your concerns, Sarah. My name is David, and I’m a local business owner. I’m worried about the economic impact. I’ve heard that legalization could bring in a lot of tax revenue, but I’m also concerned about the potential for increased healthcare costs. I’m not sure the economic benefits outweigh the risks.

**Emily:** Hi, I’m Emily. I’m a student at the university. I’m worried about the impact on young people. I think if drugs are legal, it sends the message that they’re safe, and I’m concerned that more young people will start using them. I think we need to be doing more to educate young people about the dangers of drugs, not making them more accessible.

**Michael:** My name is Michael, and I’m a retired accountant. I have to say, I see things a bit differently. I’ve been looking at the numbers, and the potential economic benefits are significant. We’re spending a fortune on the war on drugs, and it’s not working. If we legalize and regulate drugs, we could not only save that money but also bring in a substantial amount of tax revenue. That’s money we could be using to fund schools, hospitals, and other public services.

**Sarah:** I see your point, Michael, but at what cost? Are we willing to sacrifice the safety of our community for a bit of extra cash?

**David:** I agree with Sarah. It’s a big risk. We need to be sure that we have a robust regulatory system in place before we even consider legalization.

**Emily:** And what about the message we’re sending to our children? I just don’t think it’s worth it.

**Michael:** I understand your concerns, but I think you’re underestimating the potential benefits. And I think you’re overestimating the risks. We can learn from other places that have legalized drugs and put in place policies that protect public health and safety.

**Sarah:** Well, it’s clear that we have a lot to discuss. I think we should schedule another meeting to continue this conversation. How about next Tuesday, the 15th of March?

**David:** That works for me.

**Emily:** Me too.

**Michael:** I’ll be there.

**Sarah:** Great. Let’s meet at 7:00 PM in the community hall. I’ll be the contact person for the meeting. You can reach me at 07700 900123. I look forward to seeing you all there.

**Section 2**

Good evening, everyone. My name is Dr. Eleanor Vance, and I’m a public health researcher from the Institute for Health and Social Policy. I’ve been invited here tonight to talk to you about the potential impacts of drug legalization. This is a complex issue with a lot of strong opinions on both sides, and my goal tonight is not to tell you what to think, but to provide you with a balanced overview of the evidence.

First, let’s talk about the potential benefits. One of the most significant is the potential to reduce the burden on our criminal justice system. We spend a vast amount of money and resources on arresting, prosecuting, and imprisoning people for drug offenses. Legalization could free up those resources to be used in more productive ways. Furthermore, the tax revenue generated from legal drug sales could be used to fund public health and education programs, including drug prevention and treatment services.

However, we also need to consider the potential risks. A major concern is the potential for an increase in addiction and other public health costs. If drugs are more readily available and socially acceptable, it’s likely that more people will use them, and some of those people will develop problems. We also need to think about the impact on public safety. For example, there are concerns about an increase in drugged driving.

So, what does the evidence say? Well, it’s mixed. In terms of crime rates, some studies have shown a decrease in crime after legalization, while others have shown no significant change. The economic impact is also uncertain. While there is potential for tax revenue, there is also the potential for increased healthcare costs. The impact on public health is perhaps the most contentious issue. Proponents of legalization argue that it allows for better regulation and quality control, while opponents worry about the impact of increased use. The impact on young people is a particular concern, with some studies showing an increase in use among young adults after legalization. Finally, while legalization would likely lead to a reduction in the black market, it may not eliminate it entirely.

As you can see, there are no easy answers. The impact of drug legalization is likely to be complex and multifaceted. It’s a trade-off between potential benefits and potential risks. The key is to have a robust regulatory framework in place to mitigate those risks and to ensure that public health and safety are protected. Thank you.

**Section 3**

**Dr. Evans:** So, for your next assignment, you’ve chosen to focus on the ethical implications of drug legalization. That’s a very timely and important topic. Sarah, Tom, what are your initial thoughts?

**Sarah:** Well, Dr. Evans, I’ve been doing some reading, and I’m starting to think that the so-called “war on drugs” has been a costly failure. It’s led to mass incarceration, particularly of minority communities, and it hasn’t really done much to reduce drug use. I think a more just and equitable society would be one that treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.

**Tom:** I see your point, Sarah, but I’m not so sure. I’m concerned that legalization would send the wrong message to young people. It would normalize drug use and make it seem like it’s not a big deal. I think we have a responsibility to protect young people from the harms of drugs, and I’m not sure legalization is the way to do that.

**Dr. Evans:** Those are both very valid points. It’s a classic debate between individual liberty and social responsibility. Sarah, you mentioned a public health approach. What would that look like in practice?

**Sarah:** I think it would mean focusing on prevention, education, and treatment. Instead of spending billions on law enforcement and prisons, we could be investing in programs that help people make informed choices and that provide support for those who are struggling with addiction. And if we were to regulate drugs, we could ensure product safety and quality control, which would reduce the risk of overdose and other harms.

**Tom:** But what about the public safety issues? I’m worried about an increase in things like drugged driving. And what about the impact on the healthcare system? If more people are using drugs, that’s going to put a strain on our hospitals and clinics.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a key concern, Tom. Any move towards legalization would have to be accompanied by a robust regulatory framework. We can look to the regulation of other legal but potentially harmful substances, like alcohol and tobacco, for guidance. It’s about finding a balance between respecting individual autonomy and protecting the public good.

**Sarah:** Exactly. It’s not about a free-for-all. It’s about smart regulation.

**Tom:** I’m still not convinced. It just seems like a huge risk.

**Dr. Evans:** It’s a complex issue with no easy answers. That’s why it’s such a good topic for your assignment. I suggest you both do some more research on the different models of legalization and regulation that have been implemented around the world. Look at the evidence and see what conclusions you can draw.

**Sarah:** That’s a good idea. I think we need to look at this from all angles.

**Tom:** Agreed. I’m willing to keep an open mind.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. I look forward to reading your essays.

**Section 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at a fascinating case study in drug policy: the Portuguese model of drug decriminalization. In 2001, Portugal took the radical step of decriminalizing the use and possession of all illicit drugs, from cannabis to heroin. This was a bold and controversial move, and it’s one that has been closely watched by policymakers and researchers around the world.

So, why did Portugal take this step? Well, in the 1990s, the country was in the grip of a major heroin crisis. It had one of the highest rates of drug-related deaths and HIV infection in Europe. The government realized that its traditional approach of criminalization was not working. It was simply filling up the prisons and not addressing the root causes of the problem. So, it decided to try something different. The focus shifted from criminalization to a public health approach.

What does this mean in practice? Well, under the new policy, the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use is no longer a criminal offense. Instead of being arrested and sent to court, individuals are referred to what’s called a “dissuasion commission.” This commission is made up of a lawyer, a doctor, and a social worker. The goal is not to punish the individual, but to assess their situation and offer support and treatment. If the person is found to have a drug problem, they are offered a place in a treatment program. If they are not, they may be given a small fine or a warning.

The results of this policy have been remarkable. There has been a significant decrease in drug-related deaths and a dramatic reduction in the number of new HIV infections. The number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction has increased, and there has been no major increase in drug use. In fact, in some age groups, drug use has actually declined.

However, the policy is not without its critics. Some argue that the policy has not been as successful as claimed, and that it has simply moved the problem from the criminal justice system to the healthcare system. There are also concerns about the long-term sustainability of the policy, and whether it is transferable to other countries with different cultures and social contexts.

So, what can we learn from the Portuguese experience? I think there are two key lessons. First, a public health approach to drugs can be more effective than a criminal justice one. And second, decriminalization is not the same as legalization. The Portuguese model does not make drugs legal. It simply treats their use as a health issue rather than a criminal one. It’s a model that offers a valuable case study for other countries to consider as they grapple with the complex challenge of drug policy. Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates public support for the legalization of marijuana in the United States in 2025, with a breakdown by five different age demographics. Overall, the chart indicates that support for legalization is inversely proportional to age, with younger generations showing significantly more approval than older ones.

The highest level of support is seen in the 18-29 age group, where approximately 65% of individuals are in favor of legalization. This is followed by the 30-49 age group, which shows a slightly lower but still strong level of support at around 55%. 

As age increases, support for marijuana legalization steadily declines. In the 50-64 age bracket, the approval rating drops to 45%. This downward trend continues with the 65-74 age group, where only 35% of people are in favor. The lowest level of support is found among those aged 75 and over, with only a quarter of this demographic supporting the legalization of marijuana.

In summary, the data clearly shows a generational divide in attitudes towards marijuana legalization in the US, with younger people being far more likely to support it than their older counterparts.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9)

The debate over the legalization of drugs is one of the most contentious and polarizing issues of our time. Proponents argue that it represents a pragmatic and just approach to a complex social problem, while opponents warn of a potential public health catastrophe. This essay will explore both perspectives before offering a concluding opinion.

On one side of the argument, it is contended that the current prohibitionist stance on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster. The “war on drugs” has incurred enormous financial costs, led to the mass incarceration of non-violent offenders, and fueled the growth of dangerous criminal organizations. By legalizing and regulating drugs, governments could not only generate substantial tax revenue but also redirect law enforcement resources to more pressing matters. Furthermore, a regulated market would ensure product safety and quality control, thereby reducing the risk of overdose and other harms associated with contaminated illicit substances. From this perspective, legalization is not about condoning drug use, but about adopting a more effective and humane policy.

Conversely, those who oppose legalization raise legitimate concerns about the potential for a significant increase in drug use and addiction. They argue that making drugs more readily available and socially acceptable would inevitably lead to a public health crisis. The social costs of such a crisis, including increased healthcare expenditure, lost productivity, and a rise in drug-related accidents, could far outweigh any potential economic benefits. There is also the concern that legalization would normalize drug use among young people, potentially leading to long-term cognitive and developmental problems. These arguments are rooted in a precautionary principle, which prioritizes the protection of public health and safety above all else.

In my view, while the concerns of opponents are not without merit, the arguments in favor of a regulated and legalized system are more compelling. The evidence from countries that have decriminalized or legalized drugs, such as Portugal and Canada, suggests that the fears of a public health crisis are often overstated. A carefully crafted policy that combines legalization with robust public health measures, including comprehensive prevention, education, and treatment programs, offers the most promising path forward. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the failures of the past and seeks to build a more just and effective drug policy for the future.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I remember reading an article in The Guardian online a few months ago about the ongoing debate surrounding drug legalization in the UK. The article was a feature piece that explored the various arguments for and against a change in the law. It was a very balanced and well-researched article, and it really made me think about the issue in a more nuanced way.

The article presented the main arguments from both sides of the debate. On the one hand, it featured interviews with law enforcement officials and public health experts who argued that the current system is not working. They pointed to the high costs of the “war on drugs,” the rise of organized crime, and the fact that criminalizing users often prevents them from seeking help. They argued that a regulated market would allow the government to control the quality and sale of drugs, and to generate tax revenue that could be invested in public health services.

On the other hand, the article also gave a voice to those who are opposed to legalization. They were mainly concerned about the potential for an increase in addiction and other health problems, especially among young people. They argued that legalization would send the wrong message and that it would lead to a more permissive society. They also raised concerns about the potential for an increase in drug-related accidents, such as drugged driving.

My own opinion on the issue is that I tend to agree with the arguments for legalization. I think the current system is causing more harm than good. It’s not stopping people from using drugs, but it is creating a whole host of other problems. I think a regulated system, combined with a strong focus on education and treatment, would be a much more sensible and effective approach. It’s not a perfect solution, but I think it’s the best way forward.
