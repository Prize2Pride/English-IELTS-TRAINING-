### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Unseen Language of Maps**

In an age of digital navigation and readily available GPS, the traditional art of map reading might seem like a relic of the past. However, the ability to interpret the symbols, lines, and text on a paper map remains a vital skill, not just for military personnel, but for anyone who wishes to truly understand the landscape around them. A map is more than just a tool for getting from one point to another; it is a graphic representation of a portion of the earth’s surface, drawn to scale, as seen from above. It is a language in itself, and like any language, it requires a certain level of literacy to be understood.

The importance of this literacy is vividly illustrated by the experience of Major Robert K. Wright Jr., a historian for the XVIII Airborne Corps during Operation Just Cause in Panama in 1989. Tasked with a final interview, Major Wright found himself in a Humvee with a driver and an NCO, supposedly on his way to the airport. However, as they drove on, he realized they were heading in completely the wrong direction, a fact he confirmed by recognizing a landmark from previous aerial reconnaissance. A casual inquiry revealed the alarming truth: neither the driver nor the NCO had a map. They were, in effect, navigating blind. This incident serves as a stark reminder that over-reliance on others or on technology without a fundamental understanding of one's location can lead to precarious situations.

To avoid such predicaments, one must first understand the marginal information provided on a map. This information, found in the margins of the map, is the key to unlocking the map's secrets. The sheet name and number, for instance, provide the title and reference number for the map, often named after the largest settlement or natural feature on the map. The scale, another crucial piece of marginal information, gives the ratio of the distance on the map to the distance on the ground. A scale of 1:50,000, for example, indicates that one unit of measure on the map equals 50,000 of the same units on the ground. This ratio determines the level of detail that can be shown on the map; a smaller ratio allows for more detail, while a larger ratio means less detail can be included.

The map legend is another essential component of the marginal information. It identifies the symbols used to depict the prominent natural and man-made objects that exist on the ground. These symbols are not universal and can vary from map to map, especially on foreign maps. Therefore, it is crucial to check the legend to avoid misinterpretations. For example, a school might be represented by a small, black rectangle with a pennant on top, while a vineyard could be shown as a series of tiny green dots. The legend is the vocabulary of the map's language, and without it, the map remains a meaningless collection of lines and colors.

Topographic symbols, the graphic elements used to represent various features on the map, are another key aspect of map reading. These symbols, combined with different colors, allow mapmakers to create a visual representation of the landscape. Black is used for man-made features such as buildings and roads, blue for water features like lakes and rivers, and green for vegetation such as woods and orchards. Red-brown is used for cultural features and non-surveyed spot elevations. The use of color is not arbitrary; it is designed to help the map reader visualize the terrain and its features. For instance, the use of red-brown ink for major roads and built-up areas on military maps is a relatively recent innovation designed to address a specific problem. Older maps used red ink, which would disappear when viewed under a red-lens flashlight, a common tool for night navigation. The switch to red-brown ink ensures that these features remain visible, even in low-light conditions.

In conclusion, while modern technology has undoubtedly made navigation easier, the fundamental skills of map reading remain as important as ever. Understanding the marginal information, the legend, and the topographic symbols is essential for anyone who wants to be able to navigate effectively and safely, whether in a military operation or on a hiking trip. The ability to read a map is not just a practical skill; it is a form of literacy that allows us to understand and interact with the world in a more profound way.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**Navigating with Precision: Advanced Map Reading**

**A.** Beyond the basics of map reading lies a world of advanced techniques that are essential for navigating in challenging environments. While a basic understanding of a map and compass is a good starting point, those who venture off the beaten track into mountainous or difficult terrain require a more sophisticated skill set. These advanced techniques allow for precise location identification, which is crucial for both safety and efficient travel. They transform the map from a simple directional tool into a detailed guide to the landscape, enabling the user to pinpoint their position with remarkable accuracy.

**B.** One such technique is the use of transit lines. This method involves identifying two or more features on the map that will line up along your route. As you travel, there will be a single point where these features align perfectly. By drawing a line on the map that intersects both features and your path, you can determine your exact location when the features on the ground line up. This technique can also be adapted for use with linear features such as walls, fences, or streams, by extending their lines on the map to create intersecting points.

**C.** Another powerful tool for pinpointing your location is the back bearing. This technique is particularly useful when you are on a known track and can see an identifiable feature that is also on your map. By taking a compass bearing to the feature, you can calculate your position. It is important to remember to convert the magnetic bearing from your compass to a grid bearing, which is used on the map, by accounting for magnetic variation. Once the conversion is made, you can draw a line on the map from the feature at the calculated angle. The point where this line intersects your track is your approximate location.

**D.** For those navigating in open country or on an unknown track, a resection is an invaluable technique. This method involves taking bearings to three identifiable features that are spread out around you. By taking back bearings from each of these features, you will create three lines on your map that intersect to form a small triangle. Your approximate location is within this triangle. While it is possible to use only two features, this will significantly reduce the accuracy of the resection.

**E.** In the absence of prominent features, the landscape itself can provide clues to your location. The aspect of a slope, which is the direction it faces, can be a vital piece of information. By taking a compass reading of the direction a slope is facing and then finding a slope on the map with the same aspect, you can narrow down your possible location. This technique is particularly useful in hilly or mountainous terrain, where the shape of the land is a key navigational aid.

**F.** Interpreting the shape of the land on a map using contour lines is a fundamental advanced skill. These lines, which join points of equal height above sea level, provide a three-dimensional representation of the terrain on a two-dimensional surface. By understanding how to read contour lines, you can visualize the landscape, identify features such as hills, valleys, and ridges, and plan a route that takes into account the steepness of the terrain. It is important to remember, however, that the actual distance traveled on the ground will be greater than the distance measured on the map, as the map does not account for the ups and downs of the terrain.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**A Journey Through Time: The History of Cartography**

The desire to represent our surroundings is a fundamental human instinct. From the earliest cave paintings to the sophisticated digital maps of today, we have always sought to create visual representations of the world around us. This innate curiosity and the practical need to navigate, define territory, and record information have driven the development of cartography, the art and science of map-making, for thousands of years.

The earliest known maps date back to the ancient Babylonians, who created clay tablets depicting their local areas around 2300 BC. These early maps were not the precise, scientific documents we are familiar with today. Instead, they were often symbolic, focusing on features of importance to the people who created them, such as rivers, cities, and agricultural land. They were also based on a flat-Earth paradigm, a view that would persist for centuries.

It was the ancient Greeks who first began to apply a more scientific approach to cartography. Thinkers like Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus created some of the first world maps, and Eratosthenes, in the 3rd century BC, famously calculated the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy. However, it was Claudius Ptolemy, a Greek-Roman scholar living in the 2nd century AD, who is often credited as the father of modern cartography. His work, *Geographia*, was a comprehensive treatise on the subject, introducing the concepts of latitude and longitude and providing a framework for map-making that would be influential for over a thousand years.

During the Middle Ages in Europe, cartography took a step backward in some respects. Maps became more illustrative and less scientific, often incorporating religious and mythological elements. The T-O map, a symbolic representation of the world divided into three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe) separated by a T-shaped body of water and surrounded by an ocean, was a common format. However, in the Islamic world, cartography flourished. Scholars like Al-Idrisi produced detailed and accurate maps, building upon the work of Ptolemy and incorporating new information from travelers and explorers.

The Age of Discovery, from the 15th to the 17th century, was a period of rapid advancement in cartography. As European explorers set out to chart new lands and sea routes, the demand for accurate maps soared. The invention of the printing press made maps more widely available, and new projection methods, such as the Mercator projection, were developed to address the challenge of representing a spherical Earth on a flat surface. These maps were not just practical tools for navigation; they were also powerful symbols of wealth and power, reflecting the growing European influence around the world.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rise of national surveys and the development of more systematic and scientific approaches to map-making. The focus shifted from exploration to detailed topographic mapping, with governments investing heavily in the creation of accurate and comprehensive maps of their territories. The invention of new instruments, such as the theodolite and the chronometer, allowed for more precise measurements, and the use of triangulation became a standard technique for surveying large areas.

Today, we are in the midst of another cartographic revolution. The advent of computers, satellite imagery, and the Global Positioning System (GPS) has transformed the way we create and use maps. Digital maps are now ubiquitous, accessible on our phones, in our cars, and on our computers. They are dynamic, interactive, and constantly updated, providing us with a wealth of information at our fingertips. However, despite these technological advancements, the fundamental principles of cartography remain the same. The challenge of representing a complex, three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional surface, and the need to select and symbolize information in a way that is clear and understandable, are as relevant today as they were for the ancient Babylonians.

**Listening Script: Section 2**

**(Sound of a person clearing their throat)**

**Speaker:** Good morning, everyone. In the next few minutes, I want to talk to you about a skill that I believe is more important than ever in our modern, technology-driven world: the ability to read a map. In an age of GPS and satellite navigation, you might think that map reading is a dying art. But I'm here to tell you that it's a skill that can open up a whole new world of adventure and discovery, and help you to appreciate your surroundings in a way that a digital screen never can.

The map is the most important tool in any navigator's arsenal. It's a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional world, and it's packed with information. The key to unlocking that information is to understand the language of maps. This means learning to interpret the symbols, lines, and colors that are used to represent the landscape.

One of the best ways to learn is to start with a map of an area you know well, like your local park or neighborhood. This will help you to connect the symbols on the map with the real-world features they represent. As you become more confident, you can venture further afield, exploring new places and challenging yourself with more complex routes.

Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Getting lost is all part of the learning process. In fact, it can be one of the best ways to improve your skills. When you get lost, you're forced to use your map and compass to figure out where you are and how to get back on track. This is when the real learning happens.

So, I encourage you all to pick up a map, grab a compass, and head outdoors. Discover the joy of navigating for yourself, and the sense of freedom and self-reliance that comes with it. You'll be amazed at what you can achieve.

Now, let's look at some of the key features of a map. Contour lines are the brown, squiggly lines that you see all over the map. They show the shape of the land, and by learning to read them, you can get a good idea of the terrain you'll be crossing. The legend, or key, is another vital part of the map. It tells you what all the symbols mean, so you can identify features like roads, buildings, and rivers. The scale of the map tells you the relationship between the distance on the map and the distance on the ground. The north arrow is a simple but crucial feature that helps you to orient the map, so that it's aligned with the real world. Finally, the grid lines are the blue lines that form a grid across the map. They allow you to pinpoint your location with great accuracy.

**Listening Script: Section 3**

**(Sound of students chatting in a common room)**

**Chloe:** So, Tom, have you started thinking about our presentation on the history of cartography?

**Tom:** A little bit. I was thinking we could focus on a specific map projection. Maybe the Mercator projection?

**Chloe:** That's a great idea. It's probably the most famous and controversial map projection of all time.

**Tom:** Exactly. It was a real game-changer when it was created in the 16th century. For the first time, sailors could plot their course as a straight line, which made navigation so much easier.

**Chloe:** But it's also got some major problems, right? The way it distorts the size of countries.

**Tom:** That's the main issue. On a Mercator map, Greenland looks bigger than Africa, which is just ridiculous. Africa is actually 14 times bigger than Greenland.

**Chloe:** And the distortion gets worse the further you get from the equator. So countries in the northern hemisphere, like Europe and North America, look much bigger than they really are, while countries near the equator look smaller.

**Tom:** Which has led to all sorts of accusations of political bias. But you have to remember that the Mercator projection was never intended to be a true representation of the world. It was a tool for navigation, and for that purpose, it was brilliant.

**Chloe:** That's true. And it's why it was used for so long. But in the 20th century, people started to question its dominance. That's when you get the rise of alternative projections, like the Gall-Peters projection.

**Tom:** Which tries to show the correct sizes of countries. But it has its own problems. The shapes of the countries are all distorted.

**Chloe:** So it's a trade-off, isn't it? You can have the right shapes or the right sizes, but you can't have both.

**Tom:** Exactly. Every map projection has some form of distortion. It's just a question of which type of distortion you're willing to accept.

**Chloe:** It's funny, though, that even with all the technology we have today, the Mercator projection is still used for online maps, like Google Maps.

**Tom:** I know! You'd think they would have come up with something better by now. But I guess it's just a practical choice. The Mercator projection is good for showing local areas, and you can zoom in and out without the shapes of things changing.

**Chloe:** So, for our presentation, we could start by explaining how the Mercator projection works, and why it was so important. Then we could look at the problems with it, and the alternative projections that have been proposed.

**Tom:** And we could finish by discussing the social and political implications of map projections. How the way we see the world is shaped by the maps we use.

**Chloe:** Perfect. That sounds like a really interesting presentation. Let's start gathering some more information.

**Listening Script: Section 4**

**(Sound of a lecturer starting a presentation)**

**Lecturer:** Good morning. In today's lecture, I'm going to be talking about the impact of the digital revolution on the world of cartography. In the last few decades, the way we make and use maps has been transformed by two key technologies: Geographic Information Systems, or GIS, and remote sensing.

Let's start with GIS. A GIS is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and displaying data related to positions on the Earth's surface. It's an incredibly powerful tool that allows us to create and analyze maps in ways that were simply not possible before. By layering different types of information on top of each other, we can see patterns and relationships that might otherwise be hidden. For example, we could create a map that shows the relationship between crime rates and income levels in a city, or the spread of a disease over time.

Now, let's turn to remote sensing. This is the science of obtaining information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact with it. This is done by using sensors on satellites and aircraft to collect data. This data can then be processed and used to create highly detailed and accurate maps. Remote sensing has a huge range of applications, from monitoring deforestation in the Amazon rainforest to tracking the retreat of glaciers and the other effects of climate change.

So, what does the future hold for map-making? Well, one of the most exciting developments is the way that maps are becoming more interactive and personalized. We are no longer just passive consumers of maps; we are now active participants in the map-making process. We can create our own maps, add our own information, and share them with others. This trend is sometimes referred to as 'neogeography' or 'crowdsourced' mapping.

A great example of this is OpenStreetMap. You can think of it as a kind of 'Wikipedia for maps'. It's a collaborative project to create a free, editable map of the world. The project is powered by a community of volunteers who collect data using GPS devices, aerial imagery, and other free sources. This data is then uploaded to the OpenStreetMap server, where it can be used by anyone, for any purpose. The quality of the data can be surprisingly high, particularly in urban areas where there is a large community of contributors.

In conclusion, the digital revolution has had a profound impact on the world of cartography. The way we make and use maps has changed beyond recognition. However, it's important to remember that the basic principles of good cartography – clarity, accuracy, and a deep understanding of the information being presented – are still as relevant as ever.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The provided diagram illustrates the cyclical process of cartographic communication, which involves four key stages: data collection, cartographic abstraction, map reading and analysis, and map interpretation. The process begins with the real world, which is observed and measured through data collection. This information is then used to create the cartographer's image of the world.

The next stage is cartographic abstraction, where the cartographer selects and simplifies the collected data to create a map. This map is then read and analyzed by the user, who forms their own image of the world based on the information presented. Finally, the user interprets the map, relating it back to the real world.

Overall, the diagram shows that cartographic communication is a continuous loop, with information flowing from the real world to the cartographer, to the map, to the user, and back to the real world. It highlights the fact that a map is not a perfect representation of reality, but rather a simplified and selective interpretation of it. The process involves both scientific measurement and subjective interpretation, on the part of both the cartographer and the map user.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

In an era dominated by digital technology, the ubiquity of smartphones equipped with GPS has led many to question the relevance of traditional map-reading skills. While I acknowledge the convenience and utility of digital maps, I firmly believe that the ability to read a paper map remains an essential and valuable skill. This essay will argue that a reliance on digital navigation can lead to a decline in spatial awareness and problem-solving abilities, and that paper maps offer a more reliable and engaging way to interact with the world.

Firstly, the over-reliance on GPS and digital maps can atrophy our innate sense of direction and spatial reasoning. When we blindly follow the instructions of a digital device, we are not actively engaging with our surroundings or building a mental model of the landscape. This passive approach to navigation can leave us feeling disoriented and helpless if the technology fails. In contrast, the process of reading a paper map, which involves orienting the map, identifying landmarks, and plotting a course, actively stimulates the brain and strengthens our spatial awareness. This cognitive engagement is not only beneficial for navigation but also for developing broader problem-solving skills.

Secondly, paper maps are more reliable than their digital counterparts in many situations. While smartphones are dependent on battery life and a satellite signal, a paper map is a self-contained and robust tool that can be used in any environment. For those who venture into remote areas, such as hikers and mountaineers, a paper map and compass are essential safety equipment. Furthermore, a paper map provides a broader overview of an area, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the landscape and the relationships between different features. This is in stark contrast to the often-limited view provided by a small smartphone screen.

In conclusion, while digital maps are undoubtedly a useful tool for everyday navigation, they should not be seen as a replacement for the traditional skill of map reading. The ability to read a paper map fosters a deeper connection with our environment, enhances our cognitive abilities, and provides a more reliable and resilient method of navigation. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the notion that map-reading skills are no longer necessary. In fact, in an increasingly digital world, they are more important than ever.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

I’d like to talk about a time I used a map on a hiking trip in the Lake District last summer. My friends and I had planned a route to the top of a mountain called Helvellyn, and we were relying on a paper map and a compass to find our way.

We needed to use the map because the weather was very changeable, and we knew that we couldn’t rely on our phones for navigation. The signal was patchy in the mountains, and we didn’t want to risk the batteries dying. The map was an Ordnance Survey map, which is the standard for hiking in the UK. It was very detailed, showing all the paths, contour lines, and other features of the landscape.

At first, I found the map a little difficult to use. I wasn’t very experienced at map reading, and it took me a while to get used to orienting the map and relating it to the landscape around me. However, with the help of my friends, I soon got the hang of it. We used the map to follow the path, and to check our progress against the features on the ground. It was a great feeling to be able to look at the map and say, “OK, we’re here, and we need to go that way.”

After a few hours of hiking, we reached the summit of Helvellyn. The view was absolutely breathtaking, and I felt a real sense of achievement. Using the map had been a challenge, but it had also been a very rewarding experience. It had forced me to engage with my surroundings in a way that I wouldn’t have done if I had just been following a GPS. I felt like I had really earned that view, and it’s a memory that I’ll always cherish.
