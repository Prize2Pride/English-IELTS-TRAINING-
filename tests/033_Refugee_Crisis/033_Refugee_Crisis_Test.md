## READING SECTION (40 questions)

### Passage 1

The phenomenon of the refugee crisis is not a new one, but its scale and complexity in the 21st century are unprecedented. A refugee, as defined by the 1951 Refugee Convention, is a person who has fled their country of origin and is unable or unwilling to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. This definition, drafted in the aftermath of the Second World War, has been the cornerstone of international refugee law, yet the contemporary situation tests its limits. The global refugee population has swelled to tens of millions, with the majority hosted not in the affluent West, but in developing countries neighbouring the zones of conflict and instability that force people to flee.

The causes of forced displacement are multifaceted. While war and conflict remain the primary drivers, the impacts of climate change, such as desertification and rising sea levels, are increasingly recognized as significant factors. These environmental pressures, often exacerbating existing political and economic tensions, create a new category of displaced persons – ‘climate refugees’ – a term not yet formally recognized in international law. This lack of legal recognition leaves millions in a precarious state, without the protections afforded to traditional refugees. The journey for those who flee is fraught with peril. Many fall victim to human traffickers, who exploit their desperation for financial gain. The Mediterranean Sea, for instance, has become a graveyard for thousands of refugees and migrants who attempt the treacherous crossing in overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels.

Upon reaching a host country, the challenges for refugees are far from over. They often face a complex and lengthy asylum process, during which they may be housed in overcrowded camps with limited access to education, healthcare, and employment. The psychological toll of displacement, coupled with the trauma of their past experiences, can be profound. Integration into a new society is a further hurdle, with language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination posing significant obstacles. For host countries, the influx of a large number of refugees presents both challenges and opportunities. While the initial costs of providing for asylum seekers can be substantial, refugees can also contribute to the economy and society in the long run, bringing with them diverse skills and a strong will to rebuild their lives.

### Passage 2

**The Economic Impact of Refugees**

**A** The arrival of refugees in a new country is often framed in terms of crisis and cost. While the initial humanitarian response requires significant financial outlay, a growing body of research suggests that in the medium to long term, refugees can have a net positive impact on the host country's economy. This perspective, however, is often lost in the politically charged discourse that surrounds immigration. A comprehensive analysis of the economic effects of refugees requires a nuanced understanding that goes beyond the immediate fiscal burden.

**B** In the short term, refugees are recipients of aid, which can strain public services. Host governments and non-governmental organizations provide food, shelter, healthcare, and education. These expenditures stimulate local economies, as the demand for goods and services increases. For example, the construction of refugee camps can create jobs, and the procurement of supplies can benefit local businesses. However, these benefits are often localized and may not be immediately apparent to the wider population.

**C** As refugees begin to settle, they transition from being passive recipients of aid to active participants in the economy. Many refugees are entrepreneurial, starting businesses at a higher rate than the native-born population in some countries. These businesses create jobs for both refugees and locals, and contribute to the tax base. Furthermore, refugees often fill labour shortages in sectors that are unattractive to the local workforce, such as agriculture and construction. This can help to keep industries competitive and prevent labour costs from spiraling.

**D** The demographic impact of refugees can also be beneficial. In countries with aging populations and low birth rates, refugees, who are often young, can help to rejuvenate the workforce and support social security systems. Their presence can also lead to increased innovation and a more dynamic society. The diversity of skills and experiences that refugees bring can be a valuable asset, fostering creativity and new ways of thinking.

**E** However, the economic integration of refugees is not without its challenges. Barriers such as the non-recognition of foreign qualifications, language difficulties, and discrimination can prevent refugees from utilizing their full potential. This can lead to underemployment and a waste of human capital. To overcome these obstacles, host countries need to invest in language training, skills recognition programs, and anti-discrimination initiatives. Such investments, while costly in the short term, can yield significant long-term economic benefits.

**F** The fiscal impact of refugees is a complex and often contentious issue. Studies have shown that while refugees may initially be a net cost to the state, they tend to contribute more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their lifetime. The exact timeframe for this transition depends on a variety of factors, including the refugees' age, education level, and the policies of the host country. A long-term perspective is therefore essential when assessing the economic impact of refugees.

### Passage 3

**The Psychology of a Refugee**

The physical journey of a refugee is arduous, but the psychological journey is often just as, if not more, challenging. The experience of forced displacement leaves deep and lasting scars on the human psyche. Understanding the psychological impact of being a refugee is crucial for providing effective support and fostering successful integration. The trauma of war, persecution, and a perilous journey is compounded by the stresses of adapting to a new life in a foreign land. The mental health of refugees is a critical, yet often overlooked, aspect of the refugee crisis.

Pre-migration trauma is a significant factor in the mental health of refugees. Many have witnessed or experienced unimaginable violence, including the loss of loved ones, torture, and the destruction of their homes. These experiences can lead to a range of mental health conditions, most notably Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the traumatic event. Depression and anxiety disorders are also highly prevalent among refugee populations. The constant uncertainty and fear that characterize the refugee experience can take a heavy toll on their mental well-being.

The journey to a safe country, or the migration process itself, is another source of significant stress. Refugees are often exposed to further trauma during their journey, including exploitation by smugglers, violence, and the loss of companions. The uncertainty of the journey, with no guarantee of reaching a safe destination, creates a state of chronic stress. For those who are detained or held in camps, the experience can be particularly damaging. The lack of freedom, poor living conditions, and an uncertain future can exacerbate existing mental health problems and lead to new ones.

Post-migration, the challenges continue. The asylum process is often long and complex, leaving refugees in a state of limbo for months or even years. This uncertainty about their legal status is a major source of stress. Once granted asylum, refugees face the difficult task of integrating into a new society. Language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination can lead to social isolation and a sense of alienation. The pressure to succeed and the guilt of leaving loved ones behind can also contribute to their mental health burden. The resilience of refugees is remarkable, but it is not infinite. Without adequate support, the psychological wounds of displacement can fester, with long-term consequences for the individual, their family, and the host society.

Providing effective mental health support for refugees is a complex challenge. It requires a culturally sensitive approach that takes into account the specific needs and experiences of the refugee population. Traditional Western models of therapy may not always be appropriate or effective. Community-based approaches, which build on the social support networks within the refugee community, can be particularly valuable. Ultimately, addressing the mental health of refugees is not just a humanitarian imperative, but also a crucial component of successful integration. A healthy and well-supported refugee population is better equipped to rebuild their lives and contribute to their new society.

### Section 2

**(Sound of a person clearing their throat, addressing an audience)**

Good evening everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is Anna, and I'm the director of a charity called **New Beginnings**. We are a local organization dedicated to helping refugees rebuild their lives in our community. Our charity was founded in **2015** in response to the growing number of refugees arriving in the area. We realized that while there were organizations providing emergency aid, there was a lack of long-term support to help refugees integrate into society. That's where we come in. Our main focus is to provide **practical support** to help refugees become independent and self-sufficient.

We are currently looking for volunteers to help with our **language classes**. We believe that language is the key to integration, and we run classes for all levels, from complete beginners to advanced learners. We also need volunteers to help with our other services. We provide a range of support tailored to the needs of different groups.

For newly arrived families, we offer **accommodation assistance**, helping them to find suitable housing and navigate the rental market. For unaccompanied minors, who are particularly vulnerable, we provide dedicated **mental health services** to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced. For adult men, we focus on **employment support**, helping them to find jobs that match their skills and experience. For adult women, we run a number of programs, including language tuition and social groups, but our most popular service is our **children's activities** program, which gives mothers a chance to have a break and socialize. And for elderly refugees, who can often be very isolated, we provide **food parcels** and a befriending service.

We believe that everyone has something to offer, and we would be so grateful for your support. Whether you can spare a few hours a week to teach a language class, or you'd like to help with our fundraising efforts, your contribution will make a real difference. I encourage you all to **volunteer your time** and help us give refugees the new beginning they deserve. Thank you.

### Section 3

**Tutor:** So, Maria and David, you're going to present your findings on the economic impact of refugees next week. How are you getting on?

**Maria:** We've done a lot of reading, and we've found some really interesting data. I think the most surprising thing for me was the high rate of **entrepreneurship among refugees**. I had no idea they started businesses at a higher rate than the native population in some countries.

**David:** I agree. I think the media often portrays refugees in a very **negative light**, focusing on the costs and the strain on public services. But the research shows that they can have a really positive long-term fiscal impact.

**Maria:** Exactly. But there are also significant barriers to their economic integration. The biggest one seems to be the **non-recognition of qualifications**. So many skilled and experienced people are unable to work in their chosen profession because their qualifications aren't recognized.

**David:** It's such a waste of human capital. And it's why government investment in **language training** and skills recognition programs is so crucial for successful integration.

**Maria:** I think we should include a **case study of a successful refugee entrepreneur** in our presentation. It would make it more personal and engaging.

**David:** That's a great idea. But I'm a bit worried that our presentation will be too **long**. We've got so much information to cover.

**Tutor:** That's a valid concern. I would suggest that you focus on a **balanced view of the issue**. Acknowledge the challenges, but also highlight the contributions of refugees. And a case study is an excellent idea. So, what's your plan for the next few days?

**Maria:** We're going to **do more research** to find a good case study. And then we'll start putting the presentation together.

**David:** We've scheduled a meeting for **Wednesday** to work on it.

**Tutor:** Excellent. I look forward to seeing your presentation next week.

### Section 4

**(Sound of a university lecture)**

Good morning. In today's lecture, we're going to be discussing the global refugee crisis. As you know, this is a major issue of our time. In fact, the current refugee crisis is the largest since the **Second World War**. At the end of last year, there were over 100 million people forcibly displaced worldwide. That's a staggering number.

So, what are the causes of this displacement? The primary cause, as it has been for centuries, is **war and conflict**. But we are also seeing the emergence of a new and significant factor: climate change. As the planet warms, we are seeing more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and desertification. These environmental pressures are forcing people from their homes. Economic instability and **human rights violations** also play a role, creating a complex web of factors that drive people to seek refuge elsewhere.

The journey for refugees is often long, dangerous, and expensive. They are vulnerable to exploitation by **human traffickers**, who prey on their desperation. In recent years, many countries have implemented strict **border controls**, making it even more difficult for refugees to find safety.

For those who do manage to reach a host country, the challenges are far from over. The asylum process can be slow and complex, leaving refugees in a state of limbo for months or even years. They often live in **overcrowded camps** with limited access to basic services. And integration into a new society is hampered by language barriers and **discrimination**.

The international response to the refugee crisis is governed by the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is the key legal document. A cornerstone of this convention is the principle of **non-refoulement**, which states that a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. However, the current crisis has placed a huge strain on the international system, and there is a clear need for greater **international cooperation** among nations.

In conclusion, the refugee crisis is a complex and multifaceted problem with no easy answers. It requires a comprehensive and **humanitarian solution**, one that addresses the root causes of displacement, protects the rights of refugees, and promotes their successful integration into society. Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The line graph illustrates the number of asylum applications made to the European Union by individuals from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq between 2010 and 2018. The figures are presented in thousands.

Overall, it is immediately apparent that the number of asylum seekers from all three countries increased over the period, with Syrian applications experiencing the most dramatic rise. The peak for all three nationalities was between 2015 and 2016, after which the numbers began to decline.

In 2010, the number of asylum applications from all three countries was relatively low, with Iraq having the highest figure at approximately 20,000. Over the next few years, the numbers remained fairly stable. However, from 2013 onwards, there was a significant surge in applications from Syria, which skyrocketed to a peak of over 350,000 in 2015. In the same year, applications from Afghanistan and Iraq also peaked at around 180,000 and 130,000 respectively.

Following the 2015 peak, the number of asylum applications from all three countries saw a downward trend. By 2018, Syrian applications had fallen to around 50,000, while Afghan and Iraqi applications had dropped to approximately 40,000 and 30,000 respectively. Despite this decline, the figures for all three countries remained significantly higher in 2018 than they had been in 2010.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)

The debate over the extent of developed nations' responsibility to accept refugees is a complex and deeply divisive issue. While some contend that there is a moral imperative to provide sanctuary to those fleeing persecution and conflict, others argue that the primary duty of a government is to its own citizens. This essay will examine both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

On the one hand, the argument for a moral obligation to welcome refugees is compelling. Proponents of this view often point to the principles of common humanity and the historical context of international refugee law, which was established in the wake of the Second World War. Developed countries, with their relative wealth and stability, are seen as having the capacity to absorb and support those in desperate need. Furthermore, it can be argued that some developed nations bear a degree of responsibility for the instability in the regions from which refugees are fleeing, due to historical interventions or current foreign policy. The act of providing refuge is thus not merely an act of charity, but a fulfillment of a duty to uphold human rights and international law.

On the other hand, the argument that governments should prioritize their own citizens cannot be dismissed lightly. Those who hold this view often raise concerns about the potential strain on public services, such as healthcare, education, and housing. The economic cost of supporting a large number of refugees can be substantial, and in times of economic hardship, this can lead to social tension and resentment. There are also concerns about social cohesion and the challenges of integrating large numbers of people from different cultural backgrounds. From this perspective, while the plight of refugees is tragic, the primary responsibility of a government is to ensure the well-being and security of its own populace.

In my opinion, while the concerns about the impact on host countries are valid, they do not negate the moral obligation to help those in peril. The solution lies not in closing borders, but in a more equitable and collaborative international response. Developed countries should work together to share the responsibility of hosting refugees, and invest in long-term integration strategies that benefit both the refugees and the host society. By focusing on the skills and potential that refugees bring, and by fostering a climate of welcome and inclusion, it is possible to turn a perceived burden into a net benefit. Ultimately, a compassionate and well-managed approach to the refugee crisis is not only a moral imperative but also a pragmatic one, contributing to a more stable and prosperous global community.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I’d like to talk about a time I helped a family who had just moved to my city from another country. They were refugees, and they were in a very difficult situation. I got to know them through a local charity that I volunteer with. The family consisted of a mother, a father, and their two young children. They had been forced to flee their home due to war, and they had arrived in my country with very few possessions and a limited knowledge of the language.

The situation was incredibly challenging for them. They were living in temporary accommodation, and they were struggling to navigate the complex process of applying for asylum. The parents were highly educated, but their qualifications were not recognized, so they were unable to find work. The children were also finding it difficult to adjust to their new school and make friends.

I helped them in a few different ways. Firstly, I helped them with their English. I would visit them a few times a week to practice conversation and help them with any official documents they needed to understand. I also helped them to find their way around the city, showing them where to find the best shops, parks, and other local amenities. I introduced them to some of my friends, and we organized a few social events to help them feel more welcome in the community. I also helped the children with their homework and played games with them to help them feel more settled.

Looking back, I feel incredibly grateful for the experience. It was a real privilege to get to know the family and to be able to help them in a small way. It was also a very humbling experience. It made me realize how fortunate I am to have a safe and stable life, and it taught me a lot about the resilience of the human spirit. The family have since been granted asylum, and they are now doing really well. The parents have found jobs, and the children are thriving at school. I am still in touch with them, and I consider them to be good friends.
