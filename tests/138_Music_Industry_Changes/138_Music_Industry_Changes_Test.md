**READING PASSAGE 1**

The music industry, a behemoth of creativity and commerce, has undergone a series of radical transformations throughout its history. From the painstakingly transcribed sheet music of the 19th century to the intangible digital streams of the 21st, the evolution of music distribution has been a story of technological disruption and adaptation. This passage explores the key shifts in how music has been created, distributed, and consumed, highlighting the profound impact of technology on this ever-evolving industry.

Before the advent of recorded sound, music was primarily a live experience. The distribution of musical works was limited to the circulation of printed sheet music, a process that was slow, expensive, and geographically constrained. Aspiring musicians and composers relied on publishing houses to print and distribute their works, and the reach of a new composition was largely determined by the publisher's network and the physical transportation of printed scores. This era, dominated by the piano in the parlor and the orchestra in the concert hall, was characterized by a close-knit relationship between the creator, the performer, and the audience.

The invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in 1877 marked the first major turning point in the history of music distribution. For the first time, sound could be captured and reproduced, decoupling music from the live performance. The early phonographs, with their wax cylinders and limited fidelity, were initially seen as novelties, but they paved the way for the development of the gramophone and the flat disc record. By the early 20th century, the record industry was booming, and the 78-rpm disc became the standard format for music consumption. This new technology democratized access to music, allowing people to listen to their favorite artists in the comfort of their own homes. The rise of the record industry also led to the emergence of the modern record label, a powerful new entity that controlled the means of production and distribution.

The mid-20th century witnessed another wave of innovation with the introduction of the long-playing (LP) record and the compact cassette. The LP, with its longer playing time and improved sound quality, allowed for the creation of cohesive albums, transforming the way artists conceived and presented their music. The cassette, with its portability and recordability, gave consumers a new level of control over their listening experience, enabling them to create their own mixtapes and share music with their friends. These new formats further fueled the growth of the music industry, which by the 1970s had become a global entertainment powerhouse.

The digital revolution of the late 20th century ushered in the most profound and disruptive changes the music industry had ever seen. The development of the compact disc (CD) in the early 1980s marked the transition from analog to digital, offering listeners a new level of audio fidelity and durability. However, it was the advent of the internet and the MP3 file format in the 1990s that truly upended the traditional business model. The ability to compress music into small digital files and share them online led to the rise of peer-to-peer file-sharing networks like Napster, which allowed users to download and share music for free. This widespread piracy sent shockwaves through the industry, leading to a dramatic decline in physical sales and a desperate search for new business models.

The music industry's response to the digital crisis was initially defensive and litigious, but it eventually embraced the new technology, leading to the rise of legal digital music stores like Apple's iTunes. For the first time, consumers could purchase and download individual songs, unbundling the album and giving them more choice and flexibility. However, the real game-changer was the emergence of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music in the 2010s. These platforms, with their vast libraries of music and subscription-based models, have become the dominant mode of music consumption in the 21st century. While streaming has been a financial boon for the industry as a whole, it has also raised new questions about the distribution of revenue and the value of music in the digital age.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

The ascent of streaming platforms has redrawn the map of the music industry, creating a new landscape of opportunities and challenges. While the convenience of near-instant access to a virtually limitless library of music has been a clear win for consumers, the economic realities for artists and songwriters are far more complex. This passage delves into the multifaceted impact of the streaming revolution, exploring its effects on revenue models, artist discovery, and the very nature of musical creation.

At the heart of the streaming debate are the intricate and often opaque systems of royalty distribution. Unlike the straightforward transaction of purchasing a physical album or a digital download, streaming royalties are calculated based on a pro-rata system. A listener's subscription fee is pooled with all other subscription fees, and this total pot of money is then divided by the total number of streams across the platform. The resulting per-stream payout is minuscule, often a fraction of a cent. This model disproportionately benefits superstar artists with massive stream counts, while emerging and niche artists struggle to earn a sustainable income. The #BrokenRecord campaign in the UK, for instance, has highlighted the plight of many musicians who see little financial return for their work, even with hundreds of thousands of streams.

The streaming era has also fundamentally altered the way music is marketed and consumed. The album, once the cornerstone of an artist's creative output, has been de-emphasized in favor of the individual track. Playlists, both curated by editorial teams and generated by algorithms, have become the primary vehicle for music discovery. This has led to a new kind of A&R, where data analytics and playlist placement are paramount. Artists and labels now focus on creating “playlistable” tracks, often with shorter intros, catchier hooks, and a more immediate emotional impact. This has raised concerns about the homogenization of music, with some critics arguing that the pressure to conform to playlist-friendly formulas stifles artistic experimentation.

However, the democratization of distribution is an undeniable upside of the streaming revolution. In the pre-internet era, aspiring artists faced the formidable barrier of securing a record deal. Today, platforms like Spotify and Apple Music, in conjunction with independent distributors like TuneCore and DistroKid, allow anyone to upload their music and reach a global audience. This has led to an explosion of new music, with tens of thousands of tracks being uploaded to streaming services every day. This unprecedented access has leveled the playing field to some extent, allowing talented artists to build a following and a career on their own terms, without the backing of a major label.

Furthermore, the data generated by streaming platforms offers artists and their teams invaluable insights into their audience. They can see where their listeners are located, which tracks are resonating the most, and how people are discovering their music. This data can inform touring strategies, marketing campaigns, and even the creative process itself. For independent artists, in particular, this direct line to their fanbase is a powerful tool for building a sustainable career.

The future of the music industry in the streaming age is likely to be characterized by a continued push for greater transparency and fairer remuneration for artists. The debate over royalty models is far from over, and there are growing calls for a user-centric payment system, where a subscriber's fee is distributed directly to the artists they listen to. At the same time, new technologies like blockchain and NFTs are being explored as potential solutions for tracking ownership and ensuring fair compensation. While the challenges are significant, the streaming revolution has also unleashed a new wave of innovation and creativity, and the music industry continues to adapt and evolve in response to the ever-changing technological landscape.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the music industry represents the latest frontier in its ongoing technological evolution. More than just a tool for analysis or a novel production technique, AI is emerging as a creative partner, a powerful engine for personalization, and a disruptive force that challenges our fundamental understanding of artistry and intellectual property. This passage examines the burgeoning role of AI in music creation, discovery, and the business that surrounds it, considering both its transformative potential and the ethical quandaries it presents.

One of the most significant applications of AI is in the realm of music composition and production. AI-powered software can now generate original melodies, harmonies, and rhythms in a wide range of styles, from classical orchestrations to contemporary electronic beats. These tools, such as Amper Music and Jukedeck, are not designed to replace human composers but to augment their creative process. A songwriter experiencing writer's block, for instance, can use an AI to generate a starting point or to explore new harmonic possibilities. Similarly, content creators, such as YouTubers and podcasters, can use AI to generate royalty-free background music, a task that was once both time-consuming and expensive. The technology is also making inroads into audio engineering, with AI-powered mastering services like LANDR offering automated and affordable alternatives to traditional mastering engineers.

Beyond creation, AI is revolutionizing music discovery and personalization. Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music heavily rely on sophisticated algorithms to analyze listeners' habits and generate personalized recommendations. These systems, which are a form of AI, are responsible for the curated playlists, such as 'Discover Weekly' and 'New Music Mix,' that have become a primary source of new music for millions of users. By identifying patterns in listening data, these algorithms can predict which new songs a user is likely to enjoy, creating a highly personalized and engaging experience. This level of personalization is a far cry from the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional radio, and it has fundamentally changed the way we discover and connect with music.

The rise of AI-generated music also raises complex legal and ethical questions. Who is the author of a song created by an AI? Is it the programmer who designed the algorithm, the user who provided the input, or the AI itself? The current legal framework for copyright is ill-equipped to handle these questions, and there is an ongoing debate about whether AI-generated works should be eligible for copyright protection at all. Furthermore, the ability of AI to mimic the styles of existing artists has led to concerns about deepfakes and unauthorized use of an artist's likeness. The 'fake Drake' controversy, in which an AI-generated song that sounded convincingly like the famous rapper went viral, highlighted the potential for this technology to be used for malicious or deceptive purposes.

Another area where AI is making a significant impact is in the analysis of music data. Record labels and music publishers are using AI to identify potential hits, predict trends, and optimize marketing campaigns. By analyzing data from streaming services, social media, and other sources, AI can help to identify artists with high commercial potential and to target their music to the right audience. This data-driven approach to A&R is a significant departure from the traditional reliance on gut instinct and personal connections, and it has the potential to make the music industry more efficient and profitable.

Despite the anxieties it may provoke, the integration of AI into the music industry is not a zero-sum game in which human creativity is destined to be replaced by machine-generated content. Rather, it is a story of collaboration and co-evolution. AI is a powerful tool that can augment human creativity, democratize access to music creation, and provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between music and its listeners. The challenge for the industry is to navigate the ethical and legal complexities of this new technology while harnessing its transformative power to create a more vibrant, diverse, and equitable musical ecosystem. The future of music will not be written by algorithms alone, but by the artists, entrepreneurs, and innovators who are able to blend the best of human and artificial intelligence.

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The line graph illustrates the changing landscape of music sales in the United States between 2011 and 2025, comparing the revenue from CD sales, digital downloads, and streaming services.

Overall, the period witnessed a dramatic shift in music consumption, with the decline of physical formats and the meteoric rise of streaming as the dominant source of revenue. While digital downloads initially saw some growth, they ultimately followed a similar downward trend to CDs.

In 2011, CD sales were the leading format, generating approximately $3 billion. However, they experienced a steep and consistent decline throughout the period, plummeting to just under $500 million by 2025. In contrast, streaming revenue started at a mere $500 million in 2011 but grew exponentially, overtaking CD sales in 2015 and digital downloads in 2016. By 2025, streaming had become the undisputed leader, generating over $8 billion in revenue.

Digital downloads began the period at around $2.5 billion and saw a slight increase to a peak of nearly $3 billion in 2013. However, after this point, their popularity began to wane, and sales fell steadily to approximately $1 billion by 2025. This decline, though less severe than that of CDs, clearly indicates a move away from ownership-based models of music consumption towards access-based streaming services.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The advent of music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music has unequivocally revolutionized the music industry, sparking a fervent debate about its consequences. While some argue that these platforms have democratized the industry and provided unprecedented access to music, others contend that they have devalued music as an art form and created an unsustainable financial model for many artists. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering the view that, despite its flaws, streaming has had a net positive impact.

On the one hand, critics of the streaming model raise valid concerns about the financial viability for artists. The pro-rata royalty system, which pools subscription fees and distributes them based on market share, results in infinitesimally small per-stream payouts. This system disproportionately benefits global superstars who command billions of streams, leaving niche and emerging artists with a pittance. For instance, the #BrokenRecord campaign in the UK has powerfully highlighted how many musicians struggle to earn a living wage, even with seemingly impressive stream counts. This has led to accusations that streaming has devalued music, turning it into a disposable commodity rather than a cherished art form that requires significant investment and skill to create.

On the other hand, proponents of streaming emphasize its democratizing influence and the unparalleled access it provides to both artists and consumers. In the past, securing a record deal was a formidable barrier to entry, but now, independent artists can distribute their music globally with a few clicks, reaching audiences that would have been unimaginable in the pre-internet era. This has fostered a more diverse and vibrant musical landscape. Furthermore, for consumers, the ability to access a near-limitless library of music for a modest monthly fee is a remarkable proposition. The powerful recommendation algorithms of these platforms also drive music discovery, helping users to find new artists and genres they might not have otherwise encountered.

In my opinion, while the concerns about artist remuneration are legitimate and require urgent attention, the overall impact of streaming has been positive. The shift towards a more accessible and democratic music industry is a significant step forward. The solution lies not in dismantling the streaming model, but in reforming it. The implementation of a user-centric payment system, where a subscriber's fee is paid directly to the artists they listen to, would be a more equitable approach. As the industry continues to adapt to this new paradigm, the focus must be on creating a more sustainable ecosystem that fairly compensates all artists for their work, while retaining the incredible access and discovery that streaming platforms provide.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

The most significant change I’ve noticed in the music industry is the shift from owning music to streaming it. I first became aware of this around the mid-2010s. I remember having a huge collection of CDs and spending hours curating my iTunes library, but then services like Spotify started to become really popular. Suddenly, the idea of paying for individual albums seemed a bit old-fashioned when you could have access to almost everything for a monthly subscription.

This change had a huge effect on me and my friends. We stopped buying CDs and even digital downloads. Instead, we started creating and sharing playlists on Spotify. It became a much more social way of listening to music. It also changed how I discovered new artists. Instead of relying on the radio or music magazines, I started to trust the recommendations from Spotify’s algorithms, and I found a lot of great new music that way.

In the long term, I think this change will continue to shape the industry. On the one hand, it’s made music more accessible than ever before, which is fantastic for listeners. On the other hand, I’m aware that it’s made it much harder for smaller artists to make a living. I think we might see a push for fairer payment models in the future, and perhaps a renewed interest in physical formats like vinyl as people seek a more tangible connection with the music they love. But I don’t think there’s any going back from the convenience of streaming.
