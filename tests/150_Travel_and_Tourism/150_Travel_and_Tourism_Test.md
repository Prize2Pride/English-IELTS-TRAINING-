### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**Heritage at Risk from Tourism**

The threats from tourism to the natural and cultural heritage of a particular place or community can be many and diverse. A lack of adequate or appropriate presentation and communication of the significance of a place to both the visitor and members of the local or host community can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation of the culture and heritage of the place within the wider community. This lack of awareness can hinder or prevent the development of public, political and governmental support and funding to protect and conserve the place. Furthermore, an improper or inequitable balance in programmes for the interpretation and presentation of the physical attributes of a place, including its intangible aspects, contemporary cultural expression and the broader context of minority cultural or linguistic groups, can lead to an unbalanced or narrow understanding of the cultural heritage in the mind of the wider community.

Inadequate integration of cultural heritage protection and management laws and practices into social, economic, political, legislative, cultural and tourism development policies at national and regional level can diminish the protection and conservation of cultural heritage over time. Inadequate recognition of the potential conflicts between tourism projects and activities and the conservation of cultural heritage can lead to poor planning and adverse impacts on the heritage and lifestyles of the host community. Conservation, interpretation and tourism development programmes that are based on an inadequate understanding of the complex and often conflicting aspects of significance of a place can lead to a loss of authenticity and reduced appreciation of the place.

Tourism development can have adverse impacts on a place if it does not take account of the aesthetic, social and cultural dimensions, natural and cultural landscapes, bio-diversity characteristics and the broader visual context of heritage places. Excessive, poorly planned or unmonitored tourism activities and development projects can impose unacceptable levels of change on the physical characteristics, integrity, ecology and biodiversity of the place, local access and transportation systems and the social, economic and cultural well-being of the host community.

Visitors who show little respect for the sanctity of spiritual places, practices and traditions by conducting themselves in an irresponsible manner can have an adverse impact on those places and the communities that regard them as important parts of their cultural identity. Tourism activities that consciously or inadvertently encourage trade in stolen or illicit cultural property can have an adverse effect on the cultural resources of the host community. Poorly planned, designed or located visitor facilities can have an adverse impact on the significant features or ecological characteristics of heritage places.

Disrespect on the part of visitors for the rights and interests of the host community, at regional and local levels, property owners and relevant Indigenous peoples who may exercise traditional rights or responsibilities over their own land and its significant sites, including restriction of access to certain cultural practices, knowledge, beliefs, activities, artefacts or sites, can lead to conflict and have an adverse impact on the host community. Lack of consultation with host communities or Indigenous custodians in establishing goals, strategies, policies and protocols for the identification, conservation, management, presentation and interpretation of their heritage resources, cultural practices and contemporary cultural expressions, in the tourism context can lead to conflict and have an adverse impact on the host community.

If the economic, education, employment, social and cultural benefits of tourism are not distributed to the host communities in an equitable manner, both in terms of gender and geographic coverage, conflicts can arise in those communities against tourism. This can, in turn, limit the distribution of income derived from tourism for the conservation of heritage places. The use of guides and interpreters from outside a host community can minimise opportunities for the employment of local people in the communication of the significance of the place to visitors. This can discourage local people from taking a direct interest in the care and conservation of their own heritage.

A lack of integrated education and training opportunities for policy makers, planners, researchers, designers, architects, interpreters, conservators and tourism operators can hinder the resolution of the, at times, conflicting issues, opportunities and problems encountered by their colleagues. Tourism promotion programmes that create unrealistic expectations and do not responsibly inform potential visitors of the specific heritage characteristics of a place or host community can encourage them to behave inappropriately. Promotion and management of heritage places or collections that do not minimise fluctuations in arrivals and avoid excessive numbers of visitors at any one time can adversely impact both the significance of the place and the visitor experience. Tourism promotion programmes that do not encourage visitors to experience the wider cultural and natural heritage characteristics of a region or locality can limit the wider distribution of benefits and relieve the pressures on more popular places. The poorly managed promotion, distribution and sale of local crafts and other products can prevent a reasonable social and economic return to the host community, or potentially degrade their cultural integrity.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**Sustainable Tourism: Circular Benefits and Challenges**

Many regions and cities across Europe face increasing pressure from tourism. Furthermore, there is opportunity to build sustainable tourism practices before this pressure occurs and reaches a damaging level. While tourism is a vital contributor to local economies, generating employment opportunities and income flows, it also creates significant challenges. These include rising costs of housing and food, gentrification, strains on local infrastructure, land use pressures, increased waste production, impacts on culture and heritage, as well as environmental degradation.

This topic explores how these effects of tourism impact and influence the quality of life for local populations and environments. This topic not only considers the existing effects on urban areas already under pressure from tourism, but also the opportunities for urban areas rising in tourist popularity or those seeking to develop tourism in a sustainable way (i.e. prevention of and learning from adverse effects). A key challenge is identifying how circular and green solutions can help mitigate such issues, fostering sustainable and inclusive tourism practices.

Tourism provides both opportunities and challenges for local communities. Identifying desirable tourism models and assessing impacts holistically are key to achieving a balance that benefits all stakeholders. Proposals under this topic must address the multifaceted challenges of sustainable tourism in both existing urban areas and new developments. Projects should focus on innovative solutions, instruments, strategies and regulations, incentives (such as tax incentives), at local, municipal and regional level. Project should, furthermore, focus on addressing rising housing and food prices, gentrification, waste management, infrastructure provision, as well as the environmental impacts and other challenges of tourism, and related real estate developments; whilst ensuring tourism benefits are equitably distributed across local communities.

Under this topic there is also the possibility to identify circular solutions that can reduce waste from tourism by promoting sustainable practices such as refillable packaging, local recycling systems and responsible consumption in tourist hotspots. The topic also emphasises the importance of promoting slow and eco-conscious tourism models that can decrease the environmental footprints, while fostering deeper cultural exchanges and supporting local and indigenous communities so that the identity of the urban environment belongs to the local population and is not lost to the negative effects of tourism. Tourism provides both opportunities and challenges for local communities and identifying tourism models and holistic impact assessment is key to achieving a balance that benefits all stakeholders. This topic also emphases that strengthening the integration of local food systems into tourism services can enhance proximity food chains, creating direct connections between producers and tourism stakeholders while reducing supply chain emissions.

Rather than focusing on isolated technical solutions, projects are expected to approach this topic through systems thinking and place-based strategies related to this topic. Project outcomes should be both impact-oriented and process-driven, aiming to be as concrete and user-centred as possible. Projects should clearly define their expected outputs in relation to the chosen question. Expected outputs include, but are not limited to: evidence-based recommendations for policymakers, local governments and businesses; innovative models and strategies that can be piloted or implemented in tourism destinations; practical tools and frameworks for integrating circular urban economy principles into tourism; case studies and best practices from various tourism hotspots in Europe and globally; approaches to align tourism goals with the goals that benefit local community; and policy recommendations that address tourism-driven gentrification in a neighbourhood.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Grand Tour**

The Grand Tour was a traditional trip through Europe, with Italy as a key destination, undertaken by upper-class young European men of sufficient means and rank when they had come of age (about 21 years old). The custom, which flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transport in the 1840s, served as an educational rite of passage. Though it was primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of other Protestant Northern European nations, and, from the second half of the 18th century, by some North and South Americans.

By the mid-18th century, the Grand Tour had become a regular feature of aristocratic education in Central Europe as well, although it was restricted to the higher nobility. The tradition declined in Europe as enthusiasm for classical culture waned, and with the advent of accessible rail and steamship travel—an era in which Thomas Cook made the "Cook's Tour" of early mass tourism a byword starting in the 1870s. However, with the rise of industrialization in the United States in the 19th century, American Gilded Age nouveau riche adopted the Grand Tour for both sexes and among those of more advanced years as a means of gaining both exposure and association with the sophistication of Europe. Even those of lesser means sought to mimic the pilgrimage, as satirized in Mark Twain's popular travel book The Innocents Abroad in 1869.

The primary value of the Grand Tour lay in its exposure to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent. It also provided the only opportunity to view specific works of art, and possibly the only chance to hear certain music. A Grand Tour could last anywhere from several months to several years. It was commonly undertaken in the company of a cicerone, a knowledgeable guide or tutor.

Rome for many centuries had already been the destination of pilgrims, especially during Jubilee when European clergy visited the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome. In Britain, Thomas Coryat's travel book Coryat's Crudities (1611), published during the Twelve Years' Truce, was an early influence on the Grand Tour but it was the far more extensive tour through Italy as far as Naples undertaken by the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, with his wife and children in 1613–14 that established the most significant precedent. This is partly because he asked Inigo Jones, not yet established as an architect but already known as a 'great traveller' and masque designer, to act as his cicerone (guide).

Larger numbers of tourists began their tours after the Peace of Münster in 1648. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of the term (perhaps its introduction to English) was by Richard Lassels (circa 1603–1668), an expatriate Roman Catholic priest, in his book The Voyage of Italy, which was published posthumously in Paris in 1670 and then in London. Lassels's introduction listed four areas in which travel furnished "an accomplished, consummate Traveller": the intellectual, the social, the ethical (by the opportunity of drawing moral instruction from all the traveller saw), and the political.

As a young man at the outset of his account of a repeat Grand Tour, the historian Edward Gibbon remarked that "According to the law of custom, and perhaps of reason, foreign travel completes the education of an English gentleman." Consciously adapted for intellectual self-improvement, Gibbon was "revisiting the Continent on a larger and more liberal plan"; most Grand Tourists did not pause more than briefly in libraries. On the eve of the Romantic era he played a significant part in introducing, William Beckford wrote a vivid account of his Grand Tour that made Gibbon's unadventurous Italian tour look distinctly conventional.

The typical 18th-century stance was that of the studious observer travelling through foreign lands reporting his findings on human nature for those unfortunates who stayed at home. Recounting one's observations to society at large to increase its welfare was considered an obligation. The Grand Tour flourished in this mindset. In essence, the Grand Tour was neither a scholarly pilgrimage nor a religious one. Grand Tourists in the 18th century frequently traveled with entourage, which could include tutors and servants, but still Grand Tourists used guide books. Popular guide book for the Grand Tour were prolifically published from the mid 18th century onward, though guide books for major Italian cities had been in circulation since 1660. These also frequently included detailed urban maps, increasingly facilitating more independent and self-guided experiences of cities and their ruins. Grand Tour guide books were used by young aristocrats, but had the bourgeoisie purpose of helping the reader make an authoritative choice. Grand Tour hot spots were Paris and Rome. European capital cities were Grand Tour stop overs frequently requiring traveling across the Alps and forcing Grand Tourists to gaze at length at natural sights such as Mount Etna and Mount Vesuvius. Climbing mountains, crossing rivers, and purchasing souvenirs were part of the traveling experience.

**(Sound of a crowd chattering)**

**Tour Guide:** Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Eiffel Tower. My name is Pierre, and I’ll be your guide for today. Before we go up, I’d like to tell you a little bit about the history of this iconic landmark. The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle, or World’s Fair, which was held in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel, and at the time of its construction, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world. The tower is made of wrought iron and is 324 meters tall, including the antennas at the top. It has three levels that are open to the public. The first level is 57 meters high and can be reached by lift or by climbing 328 steps. Here, you can find a souvenir shop, a restaurant, and a post office where you can send a postcard with a special Eiffel Tower postmark. You can also walk on a glass floor and experience the sensation of being suspended in the air. The second level is 115 meters high and offers a stunning view of the city. It is home to the famous Michelin-starred restaurant, Le Jules Verne, where you can enjoy a gourmet meal while taking in the breathtaking scenery. You can also watch a short film about the history of the tower in the Cineiffel theatre. The top level, at a height of 276 meters, is the highest observation deck in the European Union. From here, you can enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of Paris and see famous landmarks such as the Louvre Museum, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Arc de Triomphe. You can also see a replica of Gustave Eiffel’s office, where he conducted his experiments and received famous guests. Now, if you’re ready, let’s make our way to the lifts.

_**Script for Section 3**_

**(Sound of students talking in a common room)**

**Sarah:** Hi Tom. Have you started working on the presentation for our environmental studies class?

**Tom:** Hi Sarah. Yes, I have. I’m thinking of focusing on the environmental impact of tourism.

**Sarah:** That’s a great topic. There’s so much to talk about. On the one hand, tourism can have a positive impact on the environment. For example, it can help to protect endangered species and their habitats by providing funding for conservation projects.

**Tom:** True. But on the other hand, it can also have a devastating impact. Think about the pollution caused by airplanes and cruise ships, the destruction of natural habitats to build hotels and resorts, and the waste generated by tourists.

**Sarah:** I know. It’s a double-edged sword. And we can’t forget about the impact of climate change on tourism. Rising sea levels are threatening coastal destinations, and extreme weather events are making some places too dangerous to visit.

**Tom:** Exactly. So, what’s the solution? Should we just stop traveling?

**Sarah:** I don’t think that’s realistic. But we can definitely travel more responsibly. One solution is to promote ecotourism, which is a type of tourism that focuses on nature and conservation.

**Tom:** I’ve heard of that. Ecotourism aims to minimize the negative impact of tourism on the environment and maximize the positive impact. It’s all about responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.

**Sarah:** Right. And it can have a lot of benefits. It can help to educate people about the environment, generate income for local communities, and support conservation efforts.

**Tom:** But it’s not without its challenges. It can be expensive to set up and manage ecotourism projects, and it can be difficult to ensure that the benefits are shared fairly with the local community.

**Sarah:** I agree. But I think it’s a step in the right direction. If we want to continue to enjoy the beauty of our planet, we need to find a way to make tourism more sustainable.

**Tom:** You’re right. So, for our presentation, we can discuss both the positive and negative impacts of tourism on the environment, and then propose some solutions, like ecotourism.

**Sarah:** Sounds like a plan. Let’s start gathering some more information and case studies.

**Lecturer:** Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at the history of tourism. The desire to travel and explore new places is as old as humanity itself. But tourism as we know it today is a relatively recent phenomenon. The origins of modern tourism can be traced back to the 17th century with the emergence of the Grand Tour. This was a tradition of a trip through Europe, with Italy as a key destination, undertaken by upper-class young European men of sufficient means and rank when they had come of age. The Grand Tour was an educational rite of passage, designed to expose them to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance. It was a long and expensive journey, often lasting for several years, and was undertaken in the company of a knowledgeable guide or tutor. The Grand Tour flourished for over 200 years, but it began to decline in the mid-19th century with the waning of enthusiasm for classical culture and the advent of large-scale rail transport. The man who is often credited with being the father of modern tourism is Thomas Cook. In 1841, he organized the first package tour, taking a group of temperance campaigners from Leicester to a rally in Loughborough. This marked the beginning of a new era of mass tourism, where travel became accessible to a wider range of people. The 20th century saw a further explosion in tourism, driven by the development of the automobile and the airplane, which made travel faster and more convenient than ever before. The post-war economic boom and the introduction of paid holidays also contributed to the growth of the tourism industry. In recent years, the rise of the internet and budget airlines has made it even easier and more affordable for people to travel the world. We’ve also seen the emergence of new travel trends, such as adventure tourism, which involves traveling to remote and unexplored destinations, and sustainable tourism, which aims to minimize the negative impact of tourism on the environment and local communities. So, what does the future of tourism hold? It’s likely to be shaped by a variety of factors, including technological advancements, changing consumer preferences, and global challenges such as climate change. But one thing is for sure: the human desire to travel and explore is here to stay.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the number of international tourists arriving in three different countries, labeled A, B, and C, for the years 2005 and 2010. The figures are given in millions.

Overall, Country A and Country B both experienced a growth in tourist arrivals, whereas Country C saw a decline. Country A was the most popular destination in 2010, despite being second to Country C in 2005.

In 2005, Country C received the highest number of tourists at 12 million, followed by Country A with 10 million and Country B with 8 million. However, by 2010, the situation had changed significantly. Country A’s tourist numbers rose by 5 million to 15 million, making it the top destination out of the three. Country B also saw an increase of 4 million, reaching 12 million arrivals in 2010, the same figure as Country C in 2005.

In contrast, the number of tourists visiting Country C decreased from 12 million in 2005 to 10 million in 2010, a drop of 2 million. This made it the least popular destination among the three countries by the end of the five-year period.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

Tourism is often lauded as a powerful engine for economic growth, yet it is increasingly criticized for its detrimental effects on the environment and local cultures. This essay will argue that while the economic benefits of tourism are undeniable, its negative impacts are significant and require careful management. I largely agree with the statement that tourism is a double-edged sword, and I believe that a sustainable approach is essential to mitigate its harmful consequences.

On the one hand, the economic advantages of a thriving tourism industry are substantial. It creates a wide range of employment opportunities, from hotel and restaurant staff to tour guides and souvenir vendors. This can be particularly beneficial for developing countries, providing a much-needed source of income and helping to alleviate poverty. Furthermore, tourism generates revenue for governments through taxes, which can be invested in public services such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare. For instance, countries like Spain and Thailand have built a large part of their modern economies on the back of their tourism sectors, demonstrating the transformative power of this industry.

On the other hand, the negative consequences of unchecked tourism can be severe. Environmentally, the influx of tourists can lead to problems such as increased pollution, water shortages, and the destruction of natural habitats to make way for hotels and other infrastructure. The carbon footprint of air travel is a major contributor to climate change. Culturally, the commercialization of traditions and the influx of foreign values can erode the unique identity of a place. The phenomenon of ‘overtourism’ in cities like Venice and Barcelona has led to overcrowding, a decline in the quality of life for residents, and a loss of authenticity.

In conclusion, while tourism can be a powerful tool for economic development, it is not without its drawbacks. The challenge lies in finding a balance between maximizing the economic benefits and minimizing the negative environmental and cultural impacts. This can be achieved through the implementation of sustainable tourism practices, such as promoting ecotourism, limiting the number of visitors to sensitive areas, and ensuring that the economic benefits are shared equitably with local communities. Ultimately, a responsible and well-managed approach is crucial to ensure that tourism remains a positive force for both travelers and host destinations.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

(One minute to prepare)

(Starts speaking)

A trip that stands out in my memory is a journey I took to Japan a couple of years ago. I went there in the spring, around the beginning of April, specifically to see the cherry blossoms, or ‘sakura’, as they are called in Japanese. I had always been fascinated by Japanese culture, and seeing the country in full bloom was a dream of mine.

I spent two weeks traveling around the country, starting in Tokyo and then taking the bullet train to Kyoto and Hiroshima. In Tokyo, I was blown away by the sheer scale of the city and the contrast between the futuristic skyscrapers and the ancient temples. I visited the famous Shibuya crossing, which was an incredible experience, and explored the beautiful Ueno Park, which was filled with cherry blossom trees.

In Kyoto, I immersed myself in traditional Japanese culture. I visited ancient temples and shrines, walked through the beautiful Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, and even saw a geisha in the Gion district. The city has a magical atmosphere, and it felt like stepping back in time.

This trip was so memorable for me for a number of reasons. Firstly, the beauty of the cherry blossoms was simply breathtaking. It was a truly magical experience to see the parks and streets covered in a sea of pink and white flowers. Secondly, I was deeply impressed by the kindness and hospitality of the Japanese people. Everyone I met was so polite and helpful, which made my trip even more enjoyable. Finally, the trip was a real eye-opener for me. It exposed me to a completely different culture and way of life, and it gave me a new perspective on the world. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I hope to go back to Japan again one day.
