**Reading Passage 1**

Deforestation, the purposeful clearing of forested land, is a global issue with far-reaching consequences. It is driven by a variety of human activities, including farming, livestock grazing, mining, and infrastructure development. While deforestation occurs worldwide, the highest rates of permanent forest loss are seen in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. Between 2015 and 2020, Africa, South America, and Asia experienced the most significant annual deforestation rates.

The primary driver of deforestation globally is the conversion of forests for agriculture. The rising worldwide demand for meat has led to extensive land clearing for livestock and for growing animal feed like soybeans. Urban sprawl also contributes to deforestation as land is developed for housing. In Malaysia and Indonesia, vast areas of forest are cleared for palm oil plantations. Palm oil, found in numerous consumer products, accounted for 7% of global deforestation between 2000 and 2018. In South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest, cattle ranching and soy plantations are the main culprits. The Amazon has lost approximately 17% of its forest cover in the last 50 years, with deforestation rates showing a recent upward trend.

Deforestation has a devastating impact on biodiversity. Forests are home to 80% of the Earth’s land animals and plants, and their destruction threatens countless species, including the orangutan and Sumatran tiger. The removal of the forest canopy disrupts the natural temperature regulation, leading to extreme temperature swings that can harm the local flora and fauna. Furthermore, forests provide essential resources for an estimated 5.8 billion people worldwide, who rely on non-timber forest products for their livelihoods. In India, for instance, these products can constitute up to 40% of the income for local communities.

The environmental consequences of deforestation are equally severe. It is a major cause of soil erosion, which degrades land, clogs waterways, and increases the risk of flooding. Trees play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide. When forests are cleared, this carbon is released into the atmosphere, and the planet loses a vital carbon sink. If tropical deforestation were a country, it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, behind only China and the United States. The South American rainforest, for example, influences regional and even global water cycles, and its loss has been linked to decreased rainfall and increased temperatures in the Brazilian Amazon.

Despite the grim statistics, there are reasons for hope. Conservation efforts are underway to combat illegal logging, preserve existing forest ecosystems, and restore lost tree cover through reforestation and rewilding. In Tanzania, a small island community has planted over two million trees in a decade. In South America, a coalition of organizations is working to protect and restore the Atlantic Forest. These initiatives, along with the adoption of sustainable farming practices and the use of carbon credits to fund restoration projects, offer a path towards a more sustainable future.

**Reading Passage 2**

**A**
The relationship between indigenous land ownership and the protection of forests is a complex one. While numerous examples demonstrate that indigenous stewardship can be highly effective in preserving forests, there are also instances where a lack of support and economic pressures have, unfortunately, led to deforestation. The key to successful conservation lies in providing indigenous communities with the necessary support, resources, and recognition of their rights. This enables them to sustainably manage their lands while fostering cooperation and understanding between international and local stakeholders.

**B**
It is widely acknowledged that many indigenous communities possess a profound understanding of their local ecosystems, having developed sustainable practices over generations. When granted ownership of their ancestral lands, they often manage them in ways that promote conservation and biodiversity. Numerous studies have shown that deforestation rates are often lower in areas where indigenous people have secure land tenure compared to other protected areas. This is a testament to the effectiveness of their traditional knowledge and stewardship.

**C**
Granting land rights to indigenous communities is not merely a conservation strategy; it is a matter of justice and human rights. Indigenous people have a fundamental right to their ancestral lands, and the denial of these rights can lead to conflicts and further environmental degradation. Many successful conservation initiatives involve partnerships with indigenous communities, leveraging their traditional knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes. These collaborative approaches often result in more effective and equitable conservation outcomes.

**D**
However, it is not always a simple success story. In some cases, indigenous communities may lack the resources, knowledge, or incentives to implement sustainable land management practices. This can lead to deforestation through practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture, over-harvesting of resources, and illegal logging. It is a stark reminder that land ownership alone is not a panacea for the complex issue of deforestation.

**E**
Indigenous communities often face significant economic pressures that can drive deforestation. In the absence of alternative livelihoods, some communities have resorted to selling timber or clearing land for agriculture to generate income. This is a tragic irony, where the very people who have protected the forests for generations are forced to destroy them to survive. Furthermore, some indigenous governance structures are not robust enough to enforce sustainable management practices, leading to the over-exploitation of resources by both community members and outside actors.

**F**
External exploitation is another significant threat. In some instances, corporations or illegal loggers have exploited the land through agreements or coercion with indigenous communities, leading to widespread deforestation. It is crucial to recognize that deforestation is driven by a variety of factors, including commercial agriculture, illegal logging, and infrastructure development. Blaming indigenous communities without addressing these larger systemic issues is both misleading and counterproductive. A balanced approach that respects indigenous rights while promoting sustainable practices is essential. This requires collaborative efforts involving international organizations, local NGOs, governments, and indigenous communities to create policies that support both human rights and environmental conservation.

**Reading Passage 3**

The clearing of forests is not just a threat to the world’s biodiversity and a driver of climate change; it is also a significant factor in the emergence and spread of infectious diseases in humans. As more and more forest is cleared around the world, scientists fear that the next deadly pandemic could emerge from what lives within them. A 2015 study by researchers at Ecohealth Alliance found that nearly one in three outbreaks of new and emerging diseases are linked to land-use change like deforestation.

Many viruses exist harmlessly with their host animals in forests, as these animals have co-evolved with them over long periods. However, humans can become unwitting hosts for these pathogens when they venture into or alter forest habitats. The process of deforestation brings humans and wildlife into closer contact, creating pathways for zoonotic diseases—those that can be transmitted from animals to humans—to spill over into human populations. This can happen directly, through contact with infected animals, or indirectly, through vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks.

One of the most well-documented examples of this phenomenon is the link between deforestation and malaria. In some regions, a yearly increase of just 10 percent in forest loss has been associated with a 3 percent rise in malaria cases. This is because the mosquitoes that transmit malaria often thrive in the altered environments created by deforestation. The pools of stagnant water that form in cleared areas provide ideal breeding grounds for these insects. Similarly, in Liberia, the clearing of forests for palm oil plantations has attracted hordes of typically forest-dwelling mice, which are lured by the abundance of palm fruit. These mice can carry the Lassa virus, which causes a deadly hemorrhagic fever in humans.

Deforestation has also been linked to the emergence of other serious diseases. In the Northeastern United States, there is a curious association between deforestation and Lyme disease. The bacterium that causes Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks that rely on forest-dwelling deer to breed. However, the bacterium is also found in the white-footed mouse, which thrives in forests fragmented by human settlements. In the tropics, where wildlife and pathogen diversity is higher, the risk of disease spillover is even greater. A number of diseases transmitted by a wide range of animals, from blood-sucking bugs to snails, have been linked to deforestation.

Scientists are also concerned about the unknown diseases that may be lurking in forests. As people encroach further into these pristine environments, they may come into contact with pathogens that have never before infected humans. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this problem, as it pushes animals, along with the viruses they carry, into new regions where they have never existed before. Whether these diseases remain confined to forest fringes or spread to become global pandemics depends on their mode of transmission. Some viruses, like Ebola and Nipah, can be transmitted directly between people, giving them the potential to travel around the world.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is John, and I’m here today to talk to you about a community project that I’m very passionate about. The aim of this talk is to raise awareness about a local issue and hopefully get some of you involved in our efforts to protect a very special place: the Old Oak Woodland.

The Old Oak Woodland is an ancient woodland that has been part of our community for hundreds of years. It’s a beautiful place, home to a wide variety of wildlife, including a rare species of bird, the lesser spotted woodpecker. It’s also a popular spot for walkers and families, with a network of paths and a beautiful pond.

The project was started a few years ago by a group of concerned residents, like myself, who were worried about the future of the woodland. We noticed that it was becoming neglected and that a planned housing development on its border posed a serious threat to its survival. We decided to take action and form the Friends of Old Oak Woodland.

Our main goal is to protect and preserve the woodland for future generations. We do this through a variety of activities, from practical conservation work to fundraising and awareness campaigns. We work closely with the local council, but we are an independent group, and we rely on the support of volunteers.

Now, I’d like to tell you about some of the specific tasks we need help with. The Northern Trail is one of the most popular routes through the woodland, but it has become very muddy and eroded in places. We need volunteers to help with path maintenance, which will involve laying down new gravel and improving the drainage.

The Old Oak Meadow is a beautiful open space, but it is being threatened by the spread of bracken. We need help with tree planting in this area to create a more diverse habitat.

The Dragonfly Pond is a vital habitat for many species, but it has become overgrown with reeds. We need volunteers to help with pond clearing to ensure that it remains a healthy ecosystem.

The Bluebell Woods are a spectacular sight in the spring, but they are being choked by an invasive species, the rhododendron. We need a team of volunteers to help with invasive species removal.

Finally, the main entrance to the woodland is in need of a facelift. We want to install new signage to welcome visitors and provide them with information about the woodland. So, we need volunteers to help with signage installation.

If you’re interested in getting involved, please come and talk to me after the presentation. Thank you for your time.

**SECTION 3**

**David:** Yes, but we’re having a bit of trouble deciding on a clear focus for the presentation. It’s such a huge topic.

**Dr. Evans:** I see. Well, let’s talk through some of your ideas. What have you found so far?

**Maria:** We’ve looked at the causes of deforestation, and it’s clear that it’s a complex issue with multiple drivers. It’s not just about logging; it’s also about agriculture, mining, and infrastructure development.

**David:** And we’ve been looking at the different approaches to combating deforestation. I think that the most effective way to tackle the problem is to address the demand for products that drive deforestation, like palm oil and soy.

**Maria:** I’m not so sure, David. I think that government intervention is key. Without strict regulations and penalties for companies that break the rules, I don’t think we’ll see much change.

**Dr. Evans:** Those are both valid points. But have you considered the role of indigenous communities in all of this? They are often the ones on the front line of deforestation, and they can also be powerful agents of conservation.

**Maria:** That’s a good point. We haven’t really looked at that in detail.

**David:** And what about the impact of climate change? It’s a vicious circle, isn’t it? Deforestation contributes to climate change, and climate change, in turn, makes forests more vulnerable to things like fires and disease.

**Dr. Evans:** Exactly. So, you need to think about how all these different factors are interconnected. What about the role of corporations? What have you found on that?

**Maria:** Well, it’s clear that they are a big part of the problem. But we’ve also seen that some companies are starting to take the issue more seriously. They’re making commitments to zero-deforestation supply chains.

**David:** Yes, I read a case study about a company in Costa Rica that has successfully implemented a sustainable sourcing policy. It shows that it can be done.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s an interesting example. So, what do you think you should focus on in your presentation?

**Maria:** I think we should focus on a comparison of different approaches. We could look at the pros and cons of government regulation, consumer campaigns, and corporate initiatives.

**David:** I agree. And we could use the Costa Rica case study as a specific example.

**Dr. Evans:** That sounds like a good plan. It will give your presentation a clear structure and focus. I would advise you to make your recommendations as concrete as possible. Don’t just say that governments should do more; suggest specific policies.

**Maria:** Okay, that’s helpful. So, our next step is to create a detailed outline.

**David:** Yes, and then we can divide the presentation into sections and start working on the slides.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. I look forward to seeing the final presentation.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at the crucial role that forests play in the water cycle. Now, when we think of forests, we often think of them as the “lungs of the planet,” absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. But they are also a vital part of the global water cycle, influencing everything from rainfall patterns to water quality.

So, how do forests affect rainfall? Well, trees release a huge amount of water vapor into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration. This water vapor then contributes to the formation of clouds, which, in turn, leads to rain. The presence of forests can significantly increase local and regional rainfall. In fact, some studies have shown that deforestation can lead to a significant reduction in rainfall, a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as desiccation.

But forests don’t just affect the amount of rainfall; they also have a major impact on water quality. Forest soils act as a natural filter, removing pollutants and sediment from the water as it seeps into the ground. The roots of trees also play a vital role in stabilizing the soil and preventing soil erosion. When forests are cleared, this natural filtration system is lost, which can lead to increased soil erosion and a decline in water quality.

Let’s take the Amazon rainforest as a case study. The Amazon is not only the largest rainforest in the world, but it is also a massive water pump. It generates a significant portion of its own rainfall, and it has a major influence on weather patterns across South America and beyond. Recent research has shown that deforestation in the Amazon has been linked to changes in rainfall patterns as far away as the United States.

In conclusion, it is clear that protecting and restoring forests is essential for maintaining a healthy water cycle. This has important implications for both water security and food production. As we face the challenges of climate change and a growing global population, the need to protect our forests has never been more urgent.

## TUTOR GUIDE

**Writing Task 1: Model Answer**

The chart illustrates the primary drivers of deforestation in three distinct regions—South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa—between 2010 and 2020. The data reveals that the reasons for forest clearing varied significantly across these regions, with cattle ranching being the most dominant cause in South America, while palm oil production was the main culprit in Southeast Asia.

In South America, cattle ranching was by far the most significant driver of deforestation, accounting for over 60% of forest loss. This was followed by soy cultivation, which was responsible for approximately 15% of deforestation. Logging and infrastructure development played a relatively minor role, each contributing less than 10%.

In contrast, the primary cause of deforestation in Southeast Asia was the production of palm oil, which accounted for around 55% of forest clearing. Logging was the second most significant factor, at approximately 20%. Soy cultivation and infrastructure development were less prominent causes in this region.

Africa presented a more varied picture, with no single dominant driver. The main causes of deforestation were small-scale agriculture and the collection of fuelwood, which together accounted for over 50% of forest loss. Commercial agriculture, including crops like cocoa and coffee, was also a significant factor, while logging and infrastructure development played a smaller role.

Overall, the chart demonstrates that the causes of deforestation are complex and region-specific, with different economic activities driving forest loss in different parts of the world.

**Writing Task 2: Model Essay (Band 9)**

The issue of deforestation is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, with far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, climate change, and human well-being. There is a great deal of debate about the most effective way to address this problem. While some argue that imposing strict penalties on the companies responsible is the best approach, others believe that focusing on consumer education and promoting sustainable products is more effective. This essay will discuss both these views before giving my own opinion.

On the one hand, there is a strong argument to be made for holding corporations accountable for their role in deforestation. Many of the products that we consume on a daily basis, from coffee and chocolate to beef and paper, are produced in ways that contribute to the clearing of forests. Companies that profit from these products have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure that their supply chains are not causing environmental harm. Proponents of this view argue that governments should impose strict penalties, such as large fines or even criminal charges, on companies that are found to be involved in illegal deforestation. This would create a powerful deterrent and force companies to change their practices. Furthermore, it would send a clear message that deforestation is not acceptable and that those who profit from it will be held to account.

On the other hand, some people argue that a more effective approach is to focus on the demand side of the equation. They believe that by educating consumers about the environmental impact of their purchasing decisions, we can create a market for sustainable products. If consumers demand products that are certified as deforestation-free, companies will have a financial incentive to change their practices. This approach empowers individuals to make a difference and creates a bottom-up movement for change. Moreover, it can lead to a more fundamental shift in our relationship with the environment, as people become more aware of the connections between their lifestyles and the health of the planet.

In my opinion, both of these approaches are necessary and should be pursued in parallel. While consumer education and the promotion of sustainable products are important, they are not enough on their own. The reality is that many consumers are not aware of the environmental impact of their purchases, and even those who are may not have the time or resources to research the sustainability of every product they buy. Therefore, we also need strong government regulation to ensure that all companies are held to the same standards. By combining top-down and bottom-up approaches, we can create a powerful force for change. Governments should impose strict penalties on companies that engage in deforestation, while at the same time supporting initiatives that promote consumer education and sustainable consumption.

In conclusion, the fight against deforestation requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both the supply and demand sides of the problem. While holding corporations accountable through strict penalties is crucial, it is equally important to empower consumers to make sustainable choices. By working together, governments, companies, and individuals can make a real difference in protecting our planet’s precious forests.

**Speaking Part 2: Sample Response**

I’d like to talk about the time I learned about the issue of plastic pollution in our oceans. I think I was in my late teens, and I saw a documentary on television about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I was absolutely horrified by what I saw. The documentary showed vast areas of the ocean that were literally choked with plastic waste, from tiny microplastics to large items like fishing nets and bottles.

I learned that this plastic is not only ugly and polluting, but it is also having a devastating impact on marine life. Animals like sea turtles, whales, and seabirds are mistaking plastic for food, which can lead to starvation and death. They are also getting entangled in plastic debris, which can cause serious injuries and drowning.

The documentary also explained that the problem is not just confined to the Pacific Ocean. There are similar garbage patches in all the world’s oceans, and the amount of plastic entering the marine environment is increasing every year. I learned that much of this plastic comes from single-use items like plastic bags, bottles, and straws, which we use for a few minutes and then throw away.

This information had a profound effect on me. It made me realize that my own actions, however small, were contributing to this global problem. I started to think about all the single-use plastic I was using in my daily life, and I decided to make some changes. I started carrying a reusable water bottle and coffee cup, and I stopped using plastic straws. I also became more conscious of the packaging on the products I was buying and tried to choose items with less plastic.

Learning about the issue of plastic pollution was a real wake-up call for me. It made me more aware of the environmental challenges we face and inspired me to take action in my own life. It also made me realize that we all have a role to play in protecting our planet.
