### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**READING PASSAGE 1**

What can a teacher do with the buzzing, blooming confusion that is world history? The problem is two-fold. On the one hand, the subject is infinite. On the other hand, considerable attention must be paid to the heritage of Western Civilization that shaped American institutions and made the country what it is. Mere confusion will inevitably result from an indiscriminate effort to deal with everything we know about the past; and if too little emphasis is placed on the world-transforming character of Western Civilization throughout the past 500 years, then our heritage from that truly remarkable epoch of world history will be inexcusably undervalued. As yet, there are no generally agreed upon models; historians have only recently begun to try to frame a coherent vision of the history of the world.

Yet the imperatives pointing toward a world history are obvious. In the first place, our country has become part of an intensely interactive world system that no longer revolves solely upon events in Europe, as was (or at least seemed to be) the case as recently as the 1930s. To deal effectively with Asians, Africans, Latin Americans and Europeans we need to know how the historical past has shaped their diverse outlooks upon the world. In the second place, migrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America have filled our classrooms with students whose ethnic and cultural background is not “Western.” They need a past they can share with Americans of European descent; and equally, Americans of European descent need a past they can share with all their fellow citizens, including the indigenous Indian population that got here before anyone else. World history fits these needs, and only world history can hope to do so. How then should the history of the human adventure on earth be presented in our classrooms? We need a clear and distinct idea about what matters most. Teachers might rely on a few simple rules of thumb:

1.  Human power and wealth have increased through time because people strive for them. People are perpetually on the lookout for new skills or ideas that will increase their wealth or power. Borrowing interesting new capabilities from strangers may upset existing relationships, it may arouse in some the desire to maintain local practices undefiled, and it may hurt some people while it benefits others. Still, the changeability of human history results from the modification of established ways of thinking and acting provoked most often by contacts with strangers.
2.  People are often unaware of the consequences and implications of particular actions or choices, so that human purposes are a very imperfect guide to what actually occurs. Side effects regularly distort purposes. Multiple causes are everywhere, and so are cross purposes. The open-endedness of human experience needs continual emphasis to counteract the tendency to treat whatever did happen as somehow foreordained.
3.  Students should try to make moral judgments about the past, but only after they have thought about the norms and expectations that prevailed among those being judged. Students need to know that human beings make sense of their lives by striving to conform to the norms of behavior that group membership imposes on them.

These rules of thumb about how to approach human history still do not answer the practical question of how to distribute classroom time among the infinite possibilities that world history offers. Two overarching goals should guide decision making.

First, students need to realize that they share the earth with people whose beliefs and actions are different from their own and arise for divergent cultural heritages. The way to make this clear is to define as fully and richly as possible the distinctive national traditions of the United States, and then to sample other cultural traditions, choosing for closer study those cultures of importance for global affairs in our time. Schools must therefore teach both the national history of the United States and the history of the rest of the world, paying special attention to the principal civilizations of Eurasia (including that of Western Europe) because they shaped the world views of the majority of human beings today. Africa, Latin America, North America as well as Eurasia came to share in the European heritage owing to the same processes of expansion that operated within Eurasia itself.

Secondly, students need to know that the various cultures and different civilizations that divide humanity are all part of a larger process of historical development whereby successful ideas and skills, wherever initiated, spread from people to people and culture to culture. Elaboration and diffusion of skills are as old as the emergence of humanity, whose distinctive trait is learning how to do things from others. Finds of obsidian and other scarce minerals in places remote from their origin show that Paleolithic hunters communicated across long distances. In subsequent ages, trading and raiding, missionary enterprise and mere wandering linked communities. This means that the One World of our time is not new. The speed of communication and rapidity of reaction have increased enormously, but the process of innovation and diffusion of skills is age old.

Indeed that is what defines the pattern of world history as distinct from the pattern of more local histories, including the history of separate civilizations. Accordingly, world history ought to be more organized around major breakthroughs in communication that, step by step, intensified interactions within ever larger regions of the earth until instant global communications became the pervasive reality of our own time. By focusing on the pattern of interaction, and showing how borrowed skills and ideas always had to be adapted to fit local geographical and cultural environments, a simple and commonsensical pattern for world history emerges within which detailed study of any chosen time and place will fit smoothly.

The course of study should begin with a sampling of the culture of pre-literate societies. Hunters and gatherers and autonomous villages of food producers prevailed in the distant past. A few such societies survived into modern times, allowing anthropologists to study them with insight and sympathy. That insight can and should be communicated to students just because their lives are set in an utterly different sort of social environment. But this can only be preliminary. The major focus of attention must be upon the major civilization of Eurasia.

Studying European, Chinese, Indian, and Middle Eastern civilizations with sufficient sympathy to be able to present their ideas and institutions, so to speak, “from the inside” is a formidable task. But art and literature—the “classics” of each civilization—are available, and even small excerpts from such classics can convey something of the spirit and distinctive flavor of the civilization in question. Looking at the reproductions of great works of art and reading translations from the world’s great literature invites students to react as individuals to the treasures of the human past. That experience ought to be part of every course in world history.

But random sampling of the world classics will only create confusion. Teachers can simplify without unduly distorting the reality of the four principal Eurasian cultural traditions by showing how each was built around a master institution, with a ruling idea to match. For ancient Greece, the territorial state was the ruling institution and the matching idea was natural law, applicable both to humans within the polis and to inanimate nature. For China, the extended family and the notion of decorum played a similar organizing role for the behavior of human beings and of the cosmos. For India, the master institution was caste, hierarchically ordering human relationships, while the matching idea was that the world of ordinary experience is an illusion from which to escape. For the Middle East, the master institution was the organized community of believers in a monotheistic faith, and the matching idea was the omnipotence of a single God. These four cultural traditions are not the only civilizations of the world, but they are the most influential in shaping the human present. They therefore deserve pride of place in any world history course.

World history built along these lines can prepare students to live in the interactive world of the twenty-first century more serenely and wisely than would a history that concentrates exclusively on our own past. It can also provide a basis for a new sort of cultural canon, within which the classics of our own Western tradition will continue to play a major part, but will be supplemented by classics from the other major civilizations of the world. Such a redefinition of our cultural heritage to fit the new dimensions of our lives is, I submit, the most important intellectual task of our time. It is a task in which historians have a special role to play. But they cannot succeed without the cooperation of teachers at every level of the educational system. Only by such cooperation can a vision of the human past be framed that will be capable of sustaining a tolerable human future.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

This article reflects on present and past objectives of history education. Also, we analyze two main educational trends in history teaching and learning, historical thinking and historical consciousness. Different types of historical knowledge and historical narratives taught at schools are also considered as well as the impact that different educational objectives have on students learning. Finally, some challenges to improve history education in the future are presented.

## Challenges in history education

The relationship between society and education is reciprocal. Educational curricula are developed by taking social criteria into account, in addition to disciplinary ones. In turn, student learning -the product of education-generates changes in society. In the case of historical education, the knowledge acquired has an impact that goes beyond knowledge of the past, being a social asset. Knowledge of history provides a wealth of information about issues that, in essence, are not very different from those we encounter daily in the social world. In this sense, knowledge of the past enables a reflective and critical approach to current events, allowing for greater understanding and active engagement in the present. Thus, some criticisms of HT models focus on the limited attention given to the past-present-future interrelationship. It is also considered that the past-present-future relationship should be based on disciplinary knowledge of history. All this revolves around one of the challenges of history teaching: a greater and more rigorous integration, in objectives and didactic proposals, of HT and HC.

Also, numerous studies indicate the influence that different identity narratives, such as national or cultural, could have on the understanding of the past and its relations with conflicts of present societies and their expectations for the future. Nowadays, nations are often composed of social groups with different cultural backgrounds. In this way, a HC based on exclusionary identity narratives is not sustainable today and can lead to considerable conflicts inside and outside the classroom. Therefore, a crucial challenge for history teaching is the consideration of this diversity of narratives and collective memories present in contemporary society. To resolve possible conflicts, it becomes necessary to adopt approaches based on multiperspectivity and dialogic teaching. In this way, knowledge of history would also be enriched by questioning narratives, taking into account the criteria of HT, which would allow historical narratives to be reconstructed in a less biased and a more extensive and complex way.

Today, these conflicts are present not only in the classroom, but also in digital media. The digitization of society poses a major challenge for history education that needs to be addressed, because it generates new ways of teaching and learning history. Thus, there is a need to increase research on digital platforms, which are highly influential on students’ collective memory. For example, we know very little about how the use of video games can promote history learning, and more research is needed on this topic. In this regard, we also need to increase our knowledge of how students understand historical audiovisual culture. Students are increasingly using audiovisual products on platforms such as TikTok or Instagram, and their use can be much more influential than traditional products such as textbooks. However, there is still little research on this topic. Undoubtedly one of the most urgent challenges is the use of AI in history learning. Some authors have proposed the use of AI as an educational tool for the development of a dialogue process, allowing the student to use it as a large database to ask challenging questions, especially related to the generation of inclusive historical narratives. This would facilitate a more complex and reflective view of the past. In addition, AI offers great possibilities for inquiry activities and can promote the development of HT. Another challenge linked to digitization has to do with teacher training. In order to promote the learning of history, teachers should have the technological pedagogical content knowledge of the discipline related to the issues raised here.

Finally, in many countries, teaching history is still based on the national past, and there is little global history that deals with the development of different types of societies around the world. Although national history continues to be taught, nation-states do not have the same function and structure today as they did 200 years ago, when they were created. Problems such as climate change, immigration or progressive digitalization are problems that affect many countries at the same time and whose past should be studied together in the classroom. Thus, another challenge for history teaching is that it should be a global history teaching.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

For many, history is a set of facts, a collection of events, a sequence of happenings locked in the past. For me, history is far more than these things; it is a way of seeing the world. By learning how to see the past on its own terms, how to transform the strange and unfamiliar into the logical and the comprehensible, we acquire a crucial skill for the present: a way of seeing the world that enables us to make sense of its complex currents. In an increasingly global world in which we all must make sense of people from different walks of life and different cultures, this unique skill can prove invaluable. It might seem counterintuitive to think that one of the best ways to illuminate the present is by studying the past, but that is precisely why I think history can be so important.

I am excited to be teaching an introductory history seminar on the worlds of Thomas Jefferson as it affords a terrific chance to help show students why history is as much a way of thinking, a way of seeing, a way of comprehending, as it is an inert set of things that happened. I love seeing students try to make sense of somebody from the eighteenth century—be it Jefferson or the many different kinds of people whose lives were intertwined with his own. Often, students at first are confident that they understand an eighteenth-century person, that such an individual is animated by more or less the same things that guide them today. But then, when I point out certain things that this historical figure said or did, students are instead often amazed at how peculiar the person in fact is, how unusual the individual’s assumptions, beliefs, and desires are compared to their own. And here is where students start to see things in a new way. With more probing, they begin to see how the peculiar can appear logical, how the strange can, in fact, seem so appropriate. They once again find the eighteenth-century individual comprehensible, but in a totally different way than when they began. Where initially they were inclined to impose their own beliefs and assumptions on the past, now students begin to see the past on its own terms. I am always exhilarated witnessing that transformation in vision, in seeing history come to life for students. For such a transformation certainly illuminates the eighteenth century and allows students to better understand history, but it also helps them hone a skill that they can use for the rest of their lives.

**(Audio Script - Section 2)**

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warwick Castle. My name is Tom, and I’ll be your guide for this tour. We’ll be exploring the castle’s fascinating history, from its origins in the 11th century to the present day. The tour will last for about an hour, and we’ll be visiting some of the most important parts of the castle, including the Great Hall, the Chapel, and the State Rooms.

The castle was originally a wooden motte-and-bailey fort, built by William the Conqueror in 1068. It was later rebuilt in stone in the 12th century, and it has been altered and extended many times over the centuries. The castle has played an important role in English history, and it has been home to some of the most powerful families in the country. Today, the castle is a popular tourist attraction, and it is owned and managed by Merlin Entertainments.

Now, if you look at the plan in front of you, you can see the layout of the castle. We are currently standing at the entrance, marked with an X. From here, we will walk through the main gate and into the outer courtyard. On our left, you can see the Great Hall, which is the largest and most impressive room in the castle. We will be visiting the Great Hall later in the tour.

On our right is the Chapel, which is still used for services today. Straight ahead of us are the kitchens, which have been restored to their original Victorian appearance. To the left of the kitchens is the King’s Bedroom, and to the right is the Queen’s Bedroom. We will be visiting both of these rooms, so you can see how the royal family lived when they visited the castle.

Now, if you’d like to follow me, we’ll begin our tour.

**(Audio Script - Section 3)**

**Tutor:** So, how are you getting on with your essays on the causes of World War I?

**Student 1:** We’re still in the planning stage, really. We’ve done some reading, but we’re finding it difficult to decide on a focus.

**Student 2:** There are so many different factors to consider. It’s hard to know which ones are the most important.

**Tutor:** I understand. It’s a complex topic. What have you identified as the main causes so far?

**Student 1:** Well, there’s the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, of course. But we know that’s not the whole story.

**Student 2:** We’ve also been looking at the alliance system, and how that created a kind of domino effect.

**Tutor:** Good. What else?

**Student 1:** Nationalism, imperialism, militarism… the list goes on.

**Tutor:** It certainly does. And you’re right, it’s not a simple case of one single cause. It’s a combination of long-term and short-term factors. Perhaps you could structure your essay around that distinction.

**Student 2:** That’s a good idea. We could have a section on the long-term causes, like the rise of Germany and the naval race, and then a section on the short-term causes, like the July Crisis.

**Tutor:** Exactly. And you could also consider the different historical interpretations of the causes. For example, some historians, like Fritz Fischer, have argued that Germany was primarily responsible for the outbreak of the war, while others, like Christopher Clark, have a more nuanced view.

**Student 1:** So, we could look at the historiography of the causes of World War I.

**Tutor:** Yes, that would be a very good way to approach the essay. It would show that you have a critical understanding of the topic. I’d recommend reading Margaret MacMillan’s book, “The War That Ended Peace.” It’s a very readable and comprehensive account of the origins of the war.

**Student 2:** Great, thank you. We’ll definitely check that out.

**(Audio Script - Section 4)**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be talking about the Silk Road. The Silk Road was a network of trade routes that connected the East and the West. It was named after the lucrative trade in Chinese silk, which was highly prized by the Romans. However, the Silk Road was not just about silk. It was also a conduit for the exchange of other goods, such as spices, precious metals, and exotic animals. But perhaps more importantly, the Silk Road was a channel for the transmission of ideas, technologies, and religions.

The Silk Road was not a single road, but a network of routes that stretched for thousands of miles, from China to the Mediterranean. These routes were often dangerous and difficult to travel, but they were essential for the economic and cultural life of the ancient world. The Silk Road flourished for centuries, but it went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. It was revived in the 13th and 14th centuries by the Mongols, who created a vast empire that stretched from China to Europe. The Mongol Empire was a period of unprecedented peace and stability, which made it possible for merchants and travelers to journey along the Silk Road in relative safety.

The Silk Road had a profound impact on the history of the world. It helped to spread religions such as Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam. It also facilitated the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge, such as the invention of paper and gunpowder. However, the Silk Road was also responsible for the spread of diseases, such as the bubonic plague, which killed millions of people in the 14th century.

Today, the Silk Road is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is a popular destination for tourists and travelers. It is a reminder of the importance of trade and cultural exchange, and it is a testament to the enduring power of human connection. The Silk Road is a symbol of our shared history, and it is a legacy that we should all be proud of. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of cooperation and cultural exchange in our increasingly interconnected world.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Writing Task 1: Model Answer

The provided chart illustrates the percentage change in undergraduate history course enrollments across a selection of US and Canadian institutions over three consecutive academic years, from 2020-21 to 2022-23.

Overall, the data indicates a general downward trend in history enrollments, with a slight recovery in the 2021-22 academic year. The most significant decline occurred in both the first and third years of the period shown.

In the 2020-21 academic year, history enrollments saw a decrease of 2.7%. This was followed by a modest increase of 1.0% in the 2021-22 academic year, suggesting a brief period of stabilization or renewed interest in the subject. However, this recovery was short-lived, as the 2022-23 academic year saw a return to the previous rate of decline, with enrollments falling by 2.7% once again.

In summary, the chart highlights a concerning trend for history as an academic discipline in the surveyed institutions. Despite a minor rebound in 2021-22, the overall picture is one of declining student numbers.

### Writing Task 2: Band 9 Model Essay

The question of whether to prioritize the teaching of national or world history is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. While a strong grounding in one’s own country’s history is essential for informed citizenship, I firmly believe that a comprehensive understanding of world history is ultimately more valuable in our increasingly interconnected world.

A focus on national history can foster a sense of identity and belonging. By learning about their country’s past, students can develop a deeper appreciation for their culture, traditions, and political institutions. This knowledge is crucial for active and engaged citizenship, as it provides the context for understanding current events and political debates. For example, an understanding of the American Civil Rights Movement is essential for comprehending contemporary discussions about racial inequality in the United States.

However, an exclusive focus on national history can lead to a narrow and ethnocentric worldview. It can create a sense of “us versus them,” which is counterproductive in a globalized world where cooperation and mutual understanding are paramount. In contrast, the study of world history encourages students to see themselves as part of a larger human story. It exposes them to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of life, which can foster empathy and tolerance. For instance, learning about the Silk Road can teach students about the long history of cultural exchange and interdependence between different civilizations.

Furthermore, many of the most pressing challenges we face today, such as climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality, are global in nature. To address these challenges effectively, we need to have a global perspective. The study of world history can provide this perspective by showing how different parts of the world have become interconnected and how events in one region can have far-reaching consequences.

In conclusion, while the study of national history is important, I believe that it should not come at the expense of world history. In our globalized world, a broad and inclusive understanding of the past is more important than ever. It is only by understanding the shared history of humanity that we can hope to build a more peaceful and prosperous future for all.

### Speaking Part 2: Sample Response

One historical event that I find particularly fascinating is the fall of the Berlin Wall. This momentous event took place on November 9, 1989, in Berlin, Germany. It marked the end of the Cold War and the division of Germany, which had been in place since the end of World War II.

The main consequences of the fall of the Berlin Wall were the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was a hugely symbolic moment, and it was celebrated by people all over the world. For me, the most incredible thing about it was the speed at which it happened. For decades, the Berlin Wall had been a symbol of oppression and division, and then, suddenly, it was gone.

I find this event so interesting because it shows that even the most entrenched political situations can change. It’s a story of hope and the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change. The images of people from East and West Berlin celebrating together on top of the wall are incredibly powerful and moving. It’s a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of a brighter future.
