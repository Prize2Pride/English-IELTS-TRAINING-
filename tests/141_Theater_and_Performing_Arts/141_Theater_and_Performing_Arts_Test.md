**The Ancient Roots of the Stage**

The theatre as we know it, a space for storytelling and spectacle, has a rich and complex history stretching back thousands of years. While performative elements can be found in the rituals and ceremonies of virtually every culture, the formal tradition of theatre in the Western world is generally traced back to ancient Greece. It was here, in the city-state of Athens, that theatre emerged as a distinct and celebrated art form, laying the foundations for a cultural tradition that continues to this day.

The exact origins of theatre are a subject of debate among historians. One popular theory suggests that theatre evolved from ancient religious rituals. These rituals often included elements of performance, such as costumes, masks, and choreographed movements, designed to honor gods or recount myths. Over time, it is believed, these performative elements became more elaborate and were eventually staged for their own sake, separate from their original religious context. The Greek historian Aristotle, writing in his *Poetics*, distinguished theatre from sacred mysteries by noting that theatre did not impose the same requirements on its audience, such as fasting or participating in processions. Instead, it offered a *theama*, a vision that could bring about purification and healing.

Greek theatre, which flourished in the 5th century BCE, was a cornerstone of Athenian culture. It was a civic event, a religious celebration, and a form of artistic expression all rolled into one. Performances were held in large, open-air amphitheatres, with the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens being one of the most famous. The theatrical season was centered around festivals honoring Dionysus, the god of wine and fertility. Playwrights would compete against one another, presenting a series of plays that were judged by a panel of citizens. The three main genres of Greek drama were tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. Tragedies, the oldest and most revered form, typically drew their stories from Greek mythology, exploring profound themes of human suffering and fate. Comedies, on the other hand, were satirical and often poked fun at politicians and other public figures. The satyr play, a shorter, more lighthearted piece, was usually performed after a trilogy of tragedies.

The influence of Greek theatre was immense, and it quickly spread throughout the Mediterranean world. When the Roman Republic expanded its territory, it came into contact with Greek culture and, in turn, Greek drama. The Romans, who already had their own native traditions of performance, were deeply impressed by the sophistication and artistry of Greek theatre. They began to adapt Greek plays for Roman audiences, and soon, a vibrant Roman theatrical tradition was born. Roman theatre, which reached its peak during the Roman Empire, was a diverse and eclectic art form. It encompassed everything from the slapstick comedies of Plautus to the eloquent and philosophical tragedies of Seneca. While Roman theatre was heavily indebted to its Greek predecessor, it also developed its own unique characteristics. For example, the Romans were masters of stagecraft, and their theatres were often equipped with elaborate machinery for creating special effects.

In conclusion, the journey of theatre from its ancient roots to its full flowering in Greece and Rome is a testament to the enduring power of storytelling and performance. The traditions established by these ancient cultures have had a profound and lasting impact on the development of theatre in the Western world, and their influence can still be seen in the plays and performances that we enjoy today.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Diverse World of Performing Arts**

**A.** The performing arts are a vibrant and multifaceted realm of human expression, encompassing a wide array of disciplines that are performed for an audience. Unlike the visual arts, which create static objects, the performing arts are ephemeral, existing only in the moment of their creation. From the grand spectacle of opera to the intimate storytelling of a solo mime, these art forms share a common purpose: to entertain, to provoke thought, and to stir the emotions. The performing arts are a universal feature of human culture, with each society developing its own unique traditions and styles. This passage will explore the three main pillars of the performing arts: theatre, dance, and music.

**B.** Theatre, the most narrative of the performing arts, is concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience. It is a collaborative art form, bringing together the talents of playwrights, directors, actors, designers, and technicians. While the spoken word is a key component of many theatrical traditions, theatre can also take non-verbal forms, such as mime and pantomime. The history of theatre is a long and storied one, with roots in the religious rituals of ancient societies. Over the centuries, it has evolved into a wide range of genres, from the high tragedy of Shakespeare to the lighthearted comedy of a modern sitcom. Some of the most popular forms of theatre include musicals, which combine dialogue, song, and dance; opera, a form of musical theatre in which all or most of the dialogue is sung; and improvisational theatre, in which the plot, characters, and dialogue are made up on the spot.

**C.** Dance is the art of human movement, a form of expression that is both deeply personal and universally understood. It is a powerful impulse, a primal response to the rhythms of life. While dance can be a spontaneous and unstructured activity, it is also a highly disciplined art form, with its own codified techniques and vocabularies. Ballet, with its emphasis on grace, precision, and ethereal beauty, is one of the most well-known forms of dance. However, there are countless other styles, each with its own unique history and aesthetic. Folk dance, for example, is a form of dance that is rooted in the traditions of a particular culture or community. Modern dance, which emerged in the early 20th century, rejected the rigid constraints of classical ballet in favor of a more free and expressive style of movement.

**D.** Music is perhaps the most abstract of the performing arts, a language of sound that can evoke a wide range of emotions and ideas. It is an art form that is both deeply personal and profoundly social, capable of bringing people together in a shared experience. Music can be performed by a single individual or by a large ensemble, such as an orchestra or a choir. It can be purely instrumental, or it can be combined with words to create a song. The world of music is incredibly diverse, with a vast array of genres and styles. Classical music, with its complex harmonies and structures, is one of the most revered forms of music. However, there are many other genres, such as jazz, with its emphasis on improvisation and syncopation; rock, with its powerful rhythms and rebellious spirit; and hip hop, with its intricate rhymes and infectious beats.

**E.** In addition to these three main pillars, there are many other disciplines that fall under the umbrella of the performing arts. The circus arts, for example, encompass a wide range of skills, including acrobatics, juggling, and clowning. Magic and illusion are another popular form of performing art, in which the performer creates the illusion of impossible or supernatural feats. Spoken word, which includes poetry slams and storytelling events, is a form of performance that focuses on the power and beauty of language. Puppetry, in which inanimate objects are brought to life by a puppeteer, is an ancient art form that continues to captivate audiences of all ages.

**F.** The performing arts are a vital and dynamic part of human culture. They are a reflection of who we are, a mirror of our joys and sorrows, our hopes and fears. Whether we are watching a play, listening to a concert, or marveling at the skill of a dancer, the performing arts have the power to transport us to another world, to challenge our assumptions, and to connect us with our shared humanity. In an increasingly digital world, the live, communal experience of the performing arts is more important than ever.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Stage in the Digital Age**

The world of theatre, with its long and storied history, has always been a space of innovation and adaptation. From the introduction of gaslight in the 19th century to the advent of wireless microphones in the 20th, technology has consistently played a role in shaping the theatrical experience. In the 21st century, the rise of digital technology has ushered in a new era of change, with profound implications for how theatre is created, performed, and consumed. This digital revolution is a double-edged sword, offering both exciting new possibilities and significant challenges to the traditional art form.

One of the most significant impacts of digital technology on theatre has been in the area of stagecraft. Today's theatre productions often incorporate a wide range of sophisticated technologies, including advanced lighting systems, complex sound designs, and elaborate video projections. These tools allow designers to create stunning and immersive worlds on stage, transporting audiences to fantastical landscapes or hyper-realistic settings. For example, the use of projection mapping can turn a simple set into a dynamic and ever-changing environment, while motion capture technology can allow for the seamless integration of live actors and digital characters. These technologies have expanded the creative palette of theatre artists, enabling them to tell stories in new and visually spectacular ways.

However, the increasing reliance on technology in theatre is not without its critics. Some argue that the overuse of digital effects can overshadow the human element of performance, creating a spectacle that is visually impressive but emotionally hollow. The fear is that the liveness and immediacy of theatre, its very essence, may be lost in a sea of digital wizardry. There is also the question of accessibility. The cost of implementing and maintaining these advanced technologies can be prohibitive for smaller, independent theatre companies, creating a digital divide within the industry. As a result, there is a risk that the use of cutting-edge technology could become the exclusive domain of large, well-funded productions, further marginalizing smaller and more experimental voices.

Beyond the stage, digital technology is also changing how audiences engage with theatre. The rise of streaming services and online platforms has made theatre more accessible than ever before. Audiences can now watch world-class productions from the comfort of their own homes, breaking down geographical barriers and opening up the art form to a global audience. This has been particularly important in recent times, with the COVID-19 pandemic forcing theatres to close their doors and embrace digital distribution. However, the shift to digital consumption also raises questions about the nature of the theatrical experience. Can a streamed performance truly replicate the communal and ephemeral experience of being in a theatre? Or does it create a new, hybrid art form that is something altogether different?

Furthermore, the internet and social media have transformed the way that theatre is marketed and discussed. Theatre companies can now connect directly with their audiences, building communities and generating buzz around their productions. Audience members, in turn, can share their thoughts and opinions in real-time, creating a more interactive and democratic discourse around theatre. However, this increased connectivity also has its downsides. The pressure to create “Instagrammable” moments can lead to a focus on spectacle over substance, while the fear of negative online reviews can stifle artistic risk-taking.

In conclusion, the relationship between theatre and technology is a complex and evolving one. While digital technology offers a wealth of new creative possibilities, it also poses significant challenges to the traditions and values of the art form. As we move further into the digital age, the theatre community will need to navigate these challenges thoughtfully and creatively, ensuring that technology is used to enhance, rather than diminish, the power and magic of live performance.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Grand Theatre. My name is David, and I'll be your guide for this morning's tour. The Grand Theatre is one of the city's most iconic landmarks, and we're delighted to have you here today.

The theatre was originally built in **1898**, and it has been a central part of the city's cultural life ever since. It was designed by the renowned architect Frank Matcham, who was responsible for many of the UK's most beautiful theatres. The theatre has recently undergone a major renovation project, which was completed last year. The aim of the renovation was to **restore its original features**, many of which had been lost over the years. We're very proud of the result, and we hope you'll agree that the theatre has never looked better.

The Grand Theatre is known for its **wide range of productions**. We host everything from West End musicals and blockbuster plays to stand-up comedy and live music. We also have a vibrant community outreach program, with workshops and events for people of all ages. We're passionate about making theatre accessible to everyone, and we believe that the arts have the power to transform lives.

I'd highly recommend that you **book your tickets in advance**, as our shows are often very popular. You can book online, by phone, or in person at our box office. We also have a lovely rooftop cafe, which offers stunning views of the city. It's the perfect place to relax with a drink before or after a show.

The theatre is located in the heart of the city's **historical quarter**, surrounded by beautiful architecture and charming cobbled streets. It's easily accessible by public transport, and there are several car parks nearby.

Now, let's talk about some of the exciting shows we have coming up. Next month, we have a new production of Shakespeare's *The Tempest*. This is a classic play with a modern twist, and it's sure to be a thought-provoking and visually stunning production. In December, we have the ever-popular ballet, *The Nutcracker*. This is a family-friendly show that's perfect for getting you in the Christmas spirit. In the new year, we have the long-running mystery, *The Mousetrap*, which has been playing in the West End for over 60 years. And for musical theatre fans, we have two of the biggest shows in the world: *Les Misérables*, a world-renowned musical that has been seen by over 120 million people, and *The Phantom of the Opera*, another global phenomenon. Both of these shows are on for a limited-run engagement, so be sure to book your tickets soon.

Now, if you'll follow me, we'll head inside and take a look at the auditorium...

**SECTION 3**

**Male Student:** So, what did you think of the play?

**Female Student:** I thought it was brilliant. I was completely gripped from start to finish.

**Male Student:** Really? I'm not so sure. I found the plot a bit complex and hard to follow at times.

**Female Student:** I can see that, but I thought it was a really thought-provoking story. It made me think about a lot of things.

**Male Student:** I guess so. The themes were interesting, but I just didn't connect with the characters. I found the main character, in particular, to be quite a weak and indecisive individual.

**Female Student:** I disagree. I thought he was a very sympathetic and relatable figure. He was just a normal person in an impossible situation.

**Male Student:** Hmm, I'm still not convinced. And I thought the ending was a bit abrupt and unsatisfying.

**Female Student:** I know what you mean, but I actually thought it was a very powerful and emotionally resonant ending. It left me with a lot to think about.

**Male Student:** I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. What did you think of the set design? I thought it was incredible. The way they used the lighting to create mood was so effective.

**Female Student:** Yes, I agree. The set was amazing. It was so innovative and minimalist, but it created such a strong sense of atmosphere.

**Male Student:** So, what do you think the play's main message was? I think it was about the corrupting influence of power.

**Female Student:** Yes, I think that was definitely a key theme. But I also think it was about the importance of family and the choices we make in life.

**Male Student:** That's a good point. So, who do you think this play would be most suitable for?

**Female Student:** I think it's definitely for a more mature audience. It deals with some pretty heavy themes, and it's quite a long play.

**Male Student:** I agree. So, what are we going to do for our assignment? Are we going to write a review of the play?

**Female Student:** Yes, I think so. I've already started making some notes. I think we have a lot to say about it.

**Male Student:** Me too. Even though we disagreed on some things, I think our overall impression of the play is mixed. There were things we liked and things we didn't.

**Female Student:** Exactly. It will be interesting to see how we can bring our different perspectives together in the review.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the history of musical theatre. Musical theatre is a form of theatre that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and **dance**. It's a complex and multifaceted art form, with a rich and fascinating history.

The origins of musical theatre can be traced back to a variety of sources, including opera, operetta, music hall, and vaudeville. However, the first true musical is generally considered to be *The Black Crook*, which premiered in New York City in **1866**. It was a spectacular production, with a cast of over 100, and it was a huge commercial success, running for over 400 performances.

The early 20th century saw the rise of the “book musical,” in which the songs and dances are fully **integrated** into the plot. This was a major development in the art form, and it led to the creation of some of the most beloved musicals of all time, such as *Show Boat* and *Oklahoma!*.

The “Golden Age” of musical theatre, from the 1940s to the 1960s, was dominated by the works of composers such as Rodgers and **Hammerstein**. Their musicals, such as *The Sound of Music* and *The King and I*, were known for their memorable songs, their engaging stories, and their wholesome family values.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of the “mega-musical,” characterized by its large scale and spectacular **effects**. These shows, such as *Cats* and *Les Misérables*, were global phenomena, and they transformed the economics of the theatre industry. The British composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is known for his many successful musicals, including *Cats* and *The Phantom of the **Opera***.

In recent years, there has been a trend towards “jukebox musicals,” which feature the songs of a particular artist or **group**. These shows, such as *Mamma Mia!* and *Jersey Boys*, have been hugely popular with audiences, but they have also been criticized for their lack of originality.

The musical *Hamilton*, which premiered in 2015, has been praised for its innovative and groundbreaking **approach**. With its use of hip hop music and its diverse cast, it has redefined what a musical can be, and it has attracted a new and younger audience to the theatre.

Musical theatre continues to be a popular and **vibrant** art form, with new shows and revivals opening on Broadway and in the West End every year. It's an art form that is constantly evolving, and it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this dynamic and enduring genre.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The line graph illustrates the proportion of adults in the United Kingdom who had attended a theatrical performance in the preceding three months, over a period from July 2019 to September 2025. 

Overall, the graph shows a significant fluctuation in theatre attendance, with a dramatic fall and subsequent recovery. The period begins with a relatively stable level of attendance, followed by a sharp decline, and then a gradual, but not complete, return towards the initial figures.

In July 2019, approximately 25% of adults had been to the theatre in the previous three months. This figure remained relatively steady until early 2020. However, from March 2020, there was a precipitous drop in attendance, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. By mid-2020, the percentage of adults attending the theatre had plummeted to its lowest point, close to zero.

Following this low point, a slow and steady recovery began. Throughout 2021 and 2022, theatre attendance gradually increased, reflecting the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. By September 2025, the figure had recovered to around 20%, which, while a significant improvement from the low point, was still below the pre-pandemic level of 25%. This indicates that while the theatre industry has made a strong comeback, it has not yet fully returned to its former strength.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The proliferation of digital entertainment, from on-demand streaming services to immersive video games, has led to a vigorous debate about the future of traditional performing arts. While some contend that these new forms of entertainment will inevitably lead to the demise of live theatre, others maintain that the unique qualities of a live performance will ensure its continued relevance and appeal. This essay will discuss both perspectives before arguing that theatre offers an irreplaceable experience that will continue to be valued.

On the one hand, the arguments for the decline of traditional performing arts in the face of digital competition are compelling. Digital entertainment offers unparalleled convenience and accessibility. A vast library of films, television series, and even recorded theatrical performances is available at the click of a button, often at a fraction of the cost of a theatre ticket. Furthermore, the interactive nature of video games provides a level of engagement that passive forms of entertainment, such as theatre, cannot replicate. For many, particularly the younger generation who have grown up in a digital world, the allure of these new media may prove to be irresistible, leading to a decline in theatre attendance.

On the other hand, the proponents of live theatre argue that it offers a unique and profound experience that cannot be replicated by digital media. The shared experience of being in a room with other people, all focused on the same performance, creates a sense of community and connection that is lost when watching a screen alone. The liveness of the performance, with its potential for spontaneity and error, creates a sense of immediacy and excitement that a recorded performance cannot match. Moreover, the physical presence of the actors, their voices and bodies filling the space, creates a powerful and visceral connection with the audience. This raw and unmediated experience is the very essence of theatre, and it is something that digital entertainment, for all its technological wizardry, cannot reproduce.

In my opinion, while digital entertainment will undoubtedly continue to be a dominant force in our culture, it will not lead to the extinction of the performing arts. Rather, the two will coexist, each offering a different kind of experience. The convenience and accessibility of digital media will continue to attract a large audience, but the unique and irreplaceable qualities of live performance will ensure that theatre continues to thrive. The shared human experience of storytelling, of coming together in a darkened room to witness a performance, is a fundamental part of our culture, and it is something that we will always value.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

I’d like to talk about a truly memorable experience I had at the theatre a few years ago. I went to see the musical *Wicked* at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in London. I went with my sister, who is a huge fan of musicals, and it was a birthday treat for her. We had been planning the trip for months, and the excitement had been building up for a long time.

I remember being completely blown away by the sheer scale of the production. The set was incredible, a fantastical and elaborate representation of the Land of Oz. The costumes were equally impressive, a riot of colour and creativity. And the music, of course, was just phenomenal. I had listened to the soundtrack before, but hearing the songs performed live by a full orchestra and a talented cast was a completely different experience.

What made the experience so memorable, however, was the performance of the two lead actresses who played Elphaba and Glinda. Their voices were absolutely stunning, and their acting was so powerful and convincing. I was completely drawn into the story, and I found myself becoming emotionally invested in the characters. The story itself, which is a re-imagining of *The Wizard of Oz* from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West, was so clever and thought-provoking. It challenged my preconceptions and made me see a classic story in a new light.

It was a truly magical evening, and it’s an experience that has stayed with me ever since. It reminded me of the power of live theatre to transport you to another world and to make you feel a whole range of emotions. It was a shared experience with my sister that we still talk about to this day, and it’s a memory that I will always cherish.
