# STUDENT TEST BOOKLET

The Roman Empire was one of the earliest and largest empires in human history. At their height, the empire reached from modern-day Britain to modern-day Iraq. The Romans left behind a legacy which shaped European and world history.

Before Rome was an empire, it was a republic. In the republic, the Senate held most of the political power. However, the Roman armies were often loyal to their generals, not to the Senate. This is how Julius Caesar, the father of the empire, rose to power. He and his army conquered Gaul, in modern-day France, which gave Caesar a lot of wealth and fame. The Senate was worried that he was growing too strong, and was suspicious of him. They tried to revoke his titles, but in response, he marched his army into his own hometown of Rome in 49 BC and conquered it, appointing himself 'dictator for life'.

Julius was assassinated by his rivals, but his adopted son, Octavian, succeeded him. Due to civil war and unrest in Rome, Octavian changed his name to Augustus (meaning 'great') and managed to become emperor in a series of political moves in 27 BC. His reign would launch an empire which lasted, in some form, for over 1,500 years.

The first few hundred years of the empire were incredibly stable... in contrast to the civil wars beforehand. This was the golden age of the Roman Empire-called the 'Pax Romana' or Roman peace. New conquests, like the invasion of Britannia in 43 AD by Emperor Claudius, brought new subjects under Roman control. Great works like the Colosseum, built in 80 AD, made the empire one of the most advanced in the world, and helped create unity in the empire.

The Roman Empire was famous for being both multicultural and unified. People from present-day France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and more-people who spoke different languages, and had different cultures-all considered themselves Romans. This was because newly-conquered people were granted citizenship, and a voice in the political system. It was also because Romans built roads, colosseums, baths, and other projects wherever they went. These, in many cases, made conquered peoples' quality of life increase.

Roman women had a limited form of citizenship. They could not vote. However, they owned property, ran businesses, could divorce, had equal inheritance rights to men, and were seen legally as their own individuals, not as the property of their husbands. This made Roman women much more independent than women in many other parts of the world would be for thousands of years going forward.

By 200 AD the city of Rome had grown to be the largest city in the world, with over a million people living in it. But around this time, the Pax Romana ended, and the empire started to decline. There were periods of civil war and rebellion all over the empire, because of corruption, and power struggles over who should be emperor. Many emperors died due to assassination in this time. These struggles led to increased poverty and disorder in many parts of the empire, and caused the enemies of Rome to become bolder.

The western portion of the empire was shattered by invasions until 476, when the last emperor of Rome, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed, and Italy came to be ruled by barbarian invaders. However, the eastern part of the empire, in present-day Greece and Turkey, and centered around Constantinople, was alive and well. This part of the empire is known by historians as the Byzantine Empire, though the people living in it called themselves Romans. The Byzantine Empire lasted for another 1000 years.

Ancient Greece spans hundreds of years of history starting at about 800 BC. Ancient Greece is unique in many respects. First of all, it is the first period with historiography. This means it is the first time-period about which we have historical accounts written by people who lived back then. Herodotus, born in present-day Turkey in the 400s BC, is considered the father of history.

The Greece of the past is not how we know it today. First off, it wasn't a united country. Instead, it was made up of hundreds of city-states and tribes in what is now Greece and Turkey. A city-state is a city, and the lands that surround it, which functions as an independent nation. They shared common languages, and a similar culture, but were not all ruled over by one king or system of government. Some city-states included Corinth, which was the richest, and Thebes, where legends say Hercules was born.

Warring and feuds between the city-states were very common. The most famous of these city-states are Athens and Sparta, which were bitter rivals, and fought the Peloponnesian War.

Sparta was the most militarily powerful of the city-states beginning in 650 BC. This was because of its unique system of government which was focused entirely on the military. Male Spartan citizens were taken from their parents at an extremely young age and trained rigorously. They were expected to serve in the army until they were 60 years old. This left female Spartan citizens in charge of households, giving them more rights than women in other parts of the world during this time. The rest of the population were either freedmen, responsible for trade, or slaves, who worked the fields to feed the army.

Athens, in turn, was the most populous city-state at over 360,000 people in 431 BC. It was the intellectual capital of the region, famed for its temples, arts, and theatres. During the period, it was a great center of learning, and many of the famous philosophers we know today lived here, including Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates. Though it was first ruled by kings, Athens was the site of the first democratic government in the world in 510 BC.

Athens' independence ended when Phillip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, conquered them. Alexander is of course well-known today. His story is long and complicated, but he is most famous for forming the largest land empire in history up to that point, stretching from his hometown in Greece all the way to India. However, he failed to set up mechanisms which would keep it alive after his death. In fact, when asked which of his generals the empire's rule should fall to when he died, he replied 'to the strongest.' This of course resulted in a breaking up of the empire.

Though today the wartime exploits of Sparta and Alexander the Great are celebrated in films and other forms of media, it's the intellectual pursuits of the Athenians who have made the greatest mark on the modern world. Athens, as the birthplace of democracy, laid the foundation for all that was to follow in the Western world for the next two thousand years.

Ever since the discovery of the first pyramid, scientists have wondered how ancient Egyptians built these monumental structures that are visible even from space.

There are a number of theories about the construction techniques they used. One question, however, had been left unanswered. Egyptologists had always wondered how workers were able to move the giant limestone blocks. These weigh as much as 2.5 tons each, and the stone quarries from which they were cut were often located hundreds of kilometres away from the pyramid sites.

Dragging them on basic wooden sledges, similar to those people use to slide down snow-covered slopes in winter, was the obvious answer. However, to do so would have required superhuman strength against the friction of the desert sand. It now turns out that the workers probably did have some assistance – from ordinary water! What is even more amazing is that the answer to the Egyptologists’ puzzle has been staring them in the face for many years, in a wall painting in the tomb of an ancient Egyptian king, or pharaoh.

The artwork, which depicts a pharaoh being pulled along by a large team of workers, has one significant detail that had so far been misinterpreted – a man pouring water in front of the sledge the pharaoh is being dragged upon. Egyptologists had always thought that the man was performing some kind of religious ritual. However, some scientists now believe that the water was being poured for a totally different reason. It was to help the sledge move more easily across the sand.

This revelation was made by researchers from the University of Amsterdam and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter. The scientists arrived at this conclusion after conducting extensive testing in their laboratory, by sliding a weighted tray across both dry sand and sand that had been mixed with varying amounts of water. In dry sand, heaps formed in front of the tray as it was dragged along. This slowed it down dramatically.

However, as the researchers added water, the sand hardened, which helped reduce both the force needed to pull the tray and the friction against it. That’s because the water helps form tiny water bridges, known as capillary bridges, between the sand particles, causing them to stick together. The effect of this turns out to be significant. The force required to pull the sledge would have been reduced by as much as 50% as the sand became stiffer, which meant that half as many workers were needed to move the heavy stones.

There was a tipping point, though. After the moisture exceeded a certain amount, the stiffness started to decrease and the capillary bridges melted away, causing the sand to clump up around the tray once again. According to the researchers, the perfect balance appears to be when the volume of the water is between 2 – 5% of the volume of sand. The pyramid builders seem to have realised that this was the correct proportion. And so another step has been taken towards understanding the incredible feat achieved by these ancient engineers. Now if we could only find a painting that would tell us how the workers erected these impressive structures without access to modern mechanics, that would be amazing!

**Listening Script: Section 2**

Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk to you about one of the greatest institutions of the ancient world: the Library of Alexandria. The Library of Alexandria was more than just a collection of books. It was a centre of learning and scholarship, a place where the greatest minds of the ancient world came to study and exchange ideas. In many ways, it was the ancient equivalent of a modern university.

The library was founded in the 3rd century BC by Ptolemy I Soter, a general of Alexander the Great who became the ruler of Egypt. His son, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, expanded the library, with the ambitious goal of collecting all the books in the world. To achieve this, he sent agents to buy scrolls from all over the Mediterranean, and he ordered that any book brought into Alexandria had to be copied, with the original being kept in the library.

The library was part of a larger research institution called the Mouseion, which was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts. The Mouseion was a vast complex of buildings, including the Great Hall, where scholars would dine and hold discussions; the Peripatos, a covered walkway for quiet contemplation; botanical gardens for the study of plants; an astronomical observatory for studying the stars; and even a medical school where doctors could dissect human bodies to learn about anatomy.

The library itself was housed in a magnificent building, with shelves filled with hundreds of thousands of papyrus scrolls. It was a place of great intellectual ferment, where scholars made important discoveries in mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.

So what happened to this great institution? Well, the destruction of the Library of Alexandria is one of the great mysteries of history. It wasn't a single event, but a gradual process of decline and destruction that took place over several centuries. There were a number of factors that contributed to its downfall, including a fire started by Julius Caesar's troops in 48 BC, budget cuts by later rulers, and religious conflicts. By the 4th century AD, the library had ceased to exist, and its vast collection of knowledge was lost to the world.

Now, let's look at the different parts of the Mouseion in more detail. The Great Hall, as I mentioned, was the main dining area, but it was also used for public lectures and discussions. The Peripatos was a covered walkway, a place for scholars to walk and think. The botanical gardens were used for studying plants and animals. The astronomical observatory was, of course, for studying the stars. And the medical school was a place for training doctors and treating patients. The library itself, the collection of scrolls, was housed in a separate building within the Mouseion complex.

**Listening Script: Section 3**

**Professor:** So, for our seminar today, we’re going to be discussing the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. Sarah, would you like to start?

**Sarah:** Sure. Well, from what I’ve read, it seems that there’s no single, clear reason for the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization. It was more of a gradual process, a combination of different factors.

**David:** I agree. There are a number of theories, but no one knows for sure what happened. One of the main theories is climate change. Some scientists believe that a shift in the monsoon patterns led to a long period of drought, which would have had a devastating impact on agriculture.

**Professor:** And what evidence is there to support that theory, David?

**David:** Well, there’s geological data that shows a decrease in rainfall around that time. And there’s also archaeological evidence, like the fact that many of the cities were abandoned.

**Sarah:** I’m a bit skeptical about the climate change theory. I mean, it’s a plausible explanation, but I don’t think it’s the whole story. There must have been other factors at play.

**David:** Oh, definitely. Another major factor was a decline in trade. The Indus Valley Civilization had a vast trade network, stretching as far as Mesopotamia. But for some reason, that trade seems to have collapsed.

**Sarah:** That’s right. I read that the quality of their goods, like their pottery and their beads, started to decline. And there’s also evidence that the trade routes were disrupted, possibly by conflict in the region.

**Professor:** So, we have climate change and a decline in trade. What other factors should we consider?

**David:** Well, there’s also the theory of a foreign invasion. Some historians believe that the civilization was conquered by a group of people called the Aryans.

**Sarah:** But there’s not much archaeological evidence to support that theory, is there? I mean, there are no signs of a major battle or a violent takeover.

**David:** No, you’re right. It’s a controversial theory. I think it’s more likely that it was a combination of factors, like we said before.

**Professor:** So, to sum up, it seems we can agree that the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization was a complex process with no single cause. The exact reasons are still a mystery, and it’s a topic that is still being debated by historians and archaeologists today. For your assignment, I’d like you to do some more research on one of the theories we’ve discussed today and write an essay on it. I want you to critically evaluate the evidence and present a well-reasoned argument.

**Sarah:** Okay, that sounds interesting.

**David:** Yes, I’m looking forward to it.

**Listening Script: Section 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be talking about a fascinating and enigmatic ancient civilization: the Nazca. The Nazca civilization flourished in the arid coastal plains of southern Peru from around 100 BC to 800 AD. They were a complex society with a rich culture, but they are most famous for one of the world’s greatest archaeological mysteries: the Nazca Lines.

The Nazca Lines are a series of giant geoglyphs, or designs, etched into the desert floor. There are hundreds of them, and they cover an area of about 450 square kilometers. The lines were created by removing the reddish-brown, iron oxide-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca desert. When the pebbles are removed, they reveal the lighter-colored earth underneath, creating a stark and dramatic contrast.

The geoglyphs depict a wide variety of subjects. Some are simple geometric shapes, like lines, triangles, and spirals. Others are more complex, representing animals, birds, and plants. There are images of a monkey, a spider, a hummingbird, and a whale, to name just a few. There are also a number of anthropomorphic figures, which are human-like figures with stylized features.

The purpose of the Nazca Lines is still a subject of intense debate among archaeologists and historians. One of the earliest theories was that they were connected to astronomy. The idea was that the lines were aligned with the stars, and that they were used as a kind of giant astronomical calendar, to track the seasons and predict celestial events. Another popular theory is that the lines were part of a religious ritual. The thinking is that the designs were created to be seen by the gods in the sky, and that they were used in ceremonies to ask for rain and fertile harvests.

But the Nazca were not just artists. They were also skilled engineers. They developed a sophisticated system of underground aqueducts, known as puquios, to irrigate their crops. The puquios were a series of tunnels and wells that tapped into underground water sources, allowing the Nazca to farm in one of the driest places on earth. It was a remarkable feat of engineering, and it was essential for their survival.

So what happened to the Nazca? Like many ancient civilizations, their decline was likely caused by a combination of factors. There is evidence of a major drought in the region around 600 AD, which would have had a devastating impact on their agriculture. There is also evidence of social upheaval and conflict. It’s likely that a combination of environmental and social pressures led to the collapse of the Nazca civilization.

Next week, we’ll be looking at another ancient civilization of the Americas: the Maya.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the lifespans of a selection of ancient civilizations, measured in years. The most striking feature is the vast range in longevity, with some civilizations lasting for over a millennium, while others were comparatively short-lived.

The Kushite Kingdom stands out as the most durable of the civilizations shown, with a lifespan of 1150 years. The Aksumite Empire also demonstrated remarkable longevity, lasting for 1100 years. The Vedic and Olmec civilizations also endured for a millennium.

In contrast, several civilizations had significantly shorter lifespans. The Nanda Empire and the Qin Dynasty were particularly ephemeral, lasting only 24 and 14 years respectively. The Third Dynasty of Ur also had a brief existence of just 46 years.

The various stages of Ancient Egypt (Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms) all had substantial lifespans of around 500 years each. Similarly, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire together spanned almost a millennium, with the Republic lasting 461 years and the Empire 525 years. Overall, the chart reveals a wide disparity in the durability of ancient civilizations, with a few lasting for over a thousand years, while many others collapsed in a much shorter period.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The study of ancient civilizations is a topic that elicits a wide range of opinions. Some people view it as an indulgent and impractical pursuit, a waste of valuable time and resources that could be better spent on addressing the challenges of the modern world. Others, however, contend that understanding our past is not merely an academic exercise, but a crucial prerequisite for comprehending the present and navigating the future. In my opinion, while the practical applications of studying ancient history may not always be immediately apparent, its value in providing context, perspective, and a deeper understanding of the human condition is immeasurable.

The argument that studying ancient civilizations is a waste of resources often stems from a pragmatic, results-oriented worldview. In an age of rapid technological advancement and pressing global issues such as climate change, poverty, and disease, it can be difficult to see the immediate relevance of excavating ancient ruins or deciphering long-dead languages. The funds and intellectual capital devoted to historical research, it is argued, could be more productively allocated to scientific research, technological innovation, or social programs that have a direct and tangible impact on people's lives. From this perspective, the study of the past is a luxury that a world beset by present-day problems can ill afford.

However, this viewpoint overlooks the profound and often subtle ways in which the past informs the present. Our modern societies, with their complex political systems, legal codes, and cultural norms, are not a spontaneous creation, but the product of millennia of human history. By studying ancient civilizations, we can trace the origins of our own institutions and ideas, and gain a deeper appreciation of the long and often arduous journey that has led us to where we are today. The democracy of ancient Athens, the legal principles of ancient Rome, and the philosophical insights of ancient China have all left an indelible mark on the modern world. To ignore this legacy is to view the present in a vacuum, without an understanding of the foundations upon which it is built.

Furthermore, the study of ancient civilizations offers valuable lessons and cautionary tales. The rise and fall of great empires, the causes of social and political instability, and the consequences of environmental degradation are all themes that resonate throughout history and have a direct bearing on the challenges we face today. By examining the successes and failures of our ancestors, we can gain a broader perspective on our own problems and, with any luck, avoid repeating their mistakes.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the validity of the pragmatic concerns raised by those who question the value of studying ancient history, I firmly believe that its importance far outweighs these considerations. The study of ancient civilizations is not a mere indulgence, but an essential tool for self-awareness, a source of wisdom and perspective, and a means of understanding our place in the grand sweep of human history. It is a journey into our collective past that can illuminate our present and guide us towards a more enlightened future.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

The ancient civilization that I find most interesting is Ancient Egypt. It existed in North Africa, along the banks of the Nile River, from around 3100 BC to 30 BC. I know quite a bit about it from documentaries and books. I know they built the great pyramids, which were tombs for their pharaohs, and that they had a complex system of religious beliefs. They also developed a form of writing called hieroglyphics, and they were skilled in mathematics and medicine.

I find Ancient Egypt so interesting for a number of reasons. Firstly, I’m fascinated by their incredible engineering skills. The fact that they were able to build such massive and enduring structures as the pyramids without modern technology is just mind-boggling. Secondly, I’m intrigued by their culture and religious beliefs. The idea of the afterlife, the process of mummification, and their pantheon of gods and goddesses are all so rich and complex. Finally, I think the sheer longevity of their civilization is amazing. They were around for over 3,000 years, which is a testament to their resilience and adaptability. It’s a civilization that has left a lasting legacy on the world, and one that continues to captivate and inspire people today.
