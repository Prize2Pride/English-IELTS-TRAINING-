## TUTOR GUIDE

**Writing Task 1 Model Answer**

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources in four countries, Germany, Sweden, Japan, and Australia, for the years 2015 and 2025. Overall, the chart shows a projected increase in the use of renewable electricity in all four countries over the ten-year period, with Sweden leading in both years.

In 2015, Sweden had the highest percentage of renewable electricity at 60%, followed by Germany at 40%. Australia and Japan had significantly lower proportions, at 20% and 10% respectively. By 2025, it is projected that all four countries will have increased their reliance on renewable energy. Sweden is expected to see a rise to 75%, maintaining its position as the leader. Germany's proportion is predicted to increase to 65%, while Australia and Japan are expected to reach 45% and 30% respectively.

The most significant increase is projected for Australia, with a more than twofold rise in its renewable electricity generation. Japan is also expected to see a substantial increase, tripling its 2015 figure. While Germany and Sweden are projected to have more modest increases, they will still have the highest proportions of renewable electricity among the four countries in 2025.

**Writing Task 2 Model Essay (Band 9)**

The transition to a sustainable energy future is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and there is a vigorous debate about the most effective way to encourage the widespread adoption of renewable energy. While some advocate for government financial incentives as the primary driver of change, others argue that investing in research and development (R&D) is a more critical long-term strategy. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering my own view that a combination of these approaches is ultimately the most effective.

On the one hand, financial incentives such as tax breaks and subsidies can be a powerful tool for accelerating the deployment of renewable energy technologies. By making renewables more economically competitive with fossil fuels, these incentives can encourage both individuals and businesses to invest in clean energy solutions. For example, the German government's feed-in tariff scheme, which guaranteed a fixed price for renewable electricity, was instrumental in the country's rapid expansion of solar and wind power. These incentives can create a market for new technologies, drive down costs through economies of scale, and create jobs in the green economy. However, a potential drawback of this approach is that it can be expensive for governments and may not always lead to the most efficient allocation of resources.

On the other hand, investing in R&D is crucial for developing the next generation of renewable energy technologies that will be even more efficient, affordable, and reliable. Breakthroughs in areas such as energy storage, advanced solar cells, and smart grids are essential for overcoming the technical challenges associated with a high-penetration renewable energy system. For instance, the development of cost-effective energy storage solutions is critical for balancing the intermittent nature of solar and wind power. By investing in R&D, governments can foster innovation, create new industries, and ensure that their countries remain at the forefront of the clean energy revolution. The main argument against this approach is that the benefits of R&D can take a long time to materialize, and there is no guarantee of success.

In my opinion, a balanced approach that combines both financial incentives and R&D investment is the most effective way to promote renewable energy. Financial incentives can create the initial market demand and drive down the costs of existing technologies, while R&D can ensure a pipeline of new and improved technologies for the future. By pursuing both strategies in parallel, governments can create a virtuous cycle of innovation and deployment that will accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. Ultimately, a multifaceted approach that addresses both the short-term economic barriers and the long-term technological challenges is essential for building a sustainable and prosperous future.

I'd like to talk about a time when I learned about a new technology, which was the concept of a smart grid. I first came across this idea a few years ago while I was doing some research for a university project on sustainable energy. I was reading an article online about the future of electricity distribution, and it mentioned the term 'smart grid'. I was immediately intrigued and decided to delve deeper into the topic.

I learned that a smart grid is essentially a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communication technology to gather and act on information, such as information about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in order to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity. I was fascinated by the idea of a grid that could 'think' for itself, automatically rerouting power in the event of an outage, integrating renewable energy sources seamlessly, and even communicating with smart appliances in people's homes to optimize energy consumption.

I felt a real sense of excitement and optimism when I learned about this technology. It seemed like a truly innovative solution to many of the challenges facing our current energy system. The idea that we could create a more intelligent and responsive grid that would not only be more efficient but also help to accelerate the transition to a clean energy future was incredibly inspiring. It made me realize that technology has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, and it motivated me to learn more about the role of innovation in creating a more sustainable world.
