You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Historical Perspective on Child Labor**

Child labor, the practice of employing children in work, has been a consistent feature of human societies for centuries. Historically, children were often seen as miniature adults, expected to contribute to the family's survival as soon as they were physically able. This was particularly true in agrarian societies, where farming and household chores were a collective family effort. However, the nature and scale of child labor underwent a dramatic transformation with the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The rise of factories and industrial-scale production created an unprecedented demand for cheap labor. Children, with their small stature and nimble fingers, were considered ideal for operating machinery and working in confined spaces, such as coal mines and textile mills. For impoverished families, the meager wages earned by their children were a crucial source of income, often making the difference between starvation and survival. Employers, on the other hand, benefited from the low wages and docility of child workers, who were less likely to organize and demand better working conditions.

The working conditions for these children were often appalling. Long hours, sometimes up to 16 hours a day, were the norm. The work was physically demanding and dangerous, leading to a high incidence of injuries, chronic illnesses, and even death. The cramped and unsanitary environments of factories and mines were breeding grounds for diseases like tuberculosis and cholera. Furthermore, the relentless toil deprived children of an education, trapping them in a cycle of poverty that was difficult to escape.

It was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a concerted movement to reform child labor laws began to gain momentum. Social reformers, philanthropists, and labor unions started to raise public awareness about the plight of child workers. Photographers like Lewis Hine played a pivotal role in this movement, capturing powerful images of children working in factories and mines, which shocked the public and galvanized support for reform.

Legislative efforts to regulate child labor were met with stiff resistance from industrialists and some parents who relied on their children's income. Early laws were often weak and poorly enforced. In the United States, for instance, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was a landmark piece of legislation that established a national minimum wage and a 40-hour workweek, and it also placed significant restrictions on child labor. This act prohibited the employment of minors in most non-agricultural jobs and set age limits for different types of work.

While significant progress has been made in many parts of the world to eradicate child labor, it remains a persistent problem, particularly in developing countries. The historical struggle against child labor serves as a reminder of the long and arduous journey towards ensuring that all children have the right to a safe and healthy childhood, free from exploitation and with access to education.

**Reading Passage 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Causes and Consequences of Child Labor**

**A**
Poverty is widely considered the most significant factor driving child labor. For families living on the brink of survival, every member, including children, must contribute to the household income. In many developing countries, the lack of social safety nets, such as unemployment benefits or welfare programs, exacerbates this problem. When a family's primary breadwinner loses a job or falls ill, children are often forced to drop out of school and enter the workforce to make up for the lost income. This creates a vicious cycle of poverty, as these children are denied the education that could lift them and their future families out of poverty.

**B**
Beyond poverty, a range of other factors contribute to the prevalence of child labor. In many cultures, there is a traditional view of children as a source of labor for the family. This is particularly true in rural and agrarian communities where children have historically worked on family farms. Additionally, a lack of access to quality education can make child labor a more attractive option for both parents and children. If schools are too far away, too expensive, or of poor quality, parents may not see the value in sending their children to school, especially if they can be earning an income instead.

**C**
The consequences of child labor on a child's development are profound and long-lasting. Physically, children are more vulnerable to workplace hazards than adults. Their bodies are still developing, and they are more susceptible to injuries and illnesses. The long hours and strenuous nature of the work can lead to stunted growth and chronic health problems. For example, children working in agriculture may be exposed to harmful pesticides, while those in mining may suffer from respiratory diseases due to dust inhalation.

**D**
The psychological impact of child labor can be just as damaging. Children who are forced to work are often deprived of a normal childhood. They have little time for play, socialization, or rest. The stress and trauma of working in exploitative and abusive environments can lead to long-term psychological problems, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, the lack of education and opportunities for personal development can result in low self-esteem and a sense of hopelessness.

**E**
Child labor also has broader economic and social consequences. The widespread employment of children can depress wages for adult workers, as children are often paid less for the same work. This can create a downward spiral of poverty for the entire community. Moreover, a large population of uneducated and unskilled workers can hinder a country's economic development. A nation's future prosperity depends on a well-educated and skilled workforce, and child labor undermines this by robbing children of the opportunity to reach their full potential.

**F**
Addressing the root causes of child labor requires a multi-faceted approach. This includes implementing policies that promote economic growth and reduce poverty, such as creating decent jobs for adults and establishing social protection systems. It also involves improving access to quality education and raising awareness about the harmful effects of child labor. International organizations, governments, and civil society all have a crucial role to play in creating a world where every child is free to be a child.

**Reading Passage 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**International Efforts to Combat Child Labor**

The fight against child labor has been a global concern for over a century, with the international community making concerted efforts to establish legal frameworks to protect children from exploitation. The International Labour Organization (ILO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, has been at the forefront of this movement since its inception in 1919. The ILO's fundamental mission is to promote social justice and internationally recognized human and labor rights, and the abolition of child labor is a cornerstone of its mandate.

Two of the most significant legal instruments in the fight against child labor are the ILO's Convention No. 138 on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (1973) and Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999). Convention No. 138 is a comprehensive instrument that aims to ensure the effective abolition of child labor by requiring ratifying countries to establish a minimum age for entry into work. This minimum age should not be less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling and, in any case, not less than 15 years. However, the convention allows for some flexibility, permitting a minimum age of 14 for developing countries under certain conditions.

Convention No. 182 is a more targeted and urgent instrument that calls for the immediate and effective elimination of the worst forms of child labor. This convention defines the worst forms of child labor as: all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and trafficking of children, debt bondage, and serfdom; the use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography, or for pornographic performances; the use, procuring, or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs; and work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children.

The universal ratification of Convention No. 182 in 2020 marked a historic milestone, making it the first ILO convention to be ratified by all 187 member states. This demonstrates a global consensus on the urgency of eradicating the most egregious forms of child labor. While the legal frameworks are in place, the challenge lies in their effective implementation and enforcement. Many countries that have ratified these conventions still struggle with high rates of child labor due to a lack of resources, political will, and the persistence of poverty and social norms that condone child work.

In addition to the ILO's efforts, other international organizations and initiatives play a crucial role in the fight against child labor. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, works to protect the rights of every child, including the right to be protected from economic exploitation. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, include a specific target (Target 8.7) to end child labor in all its forms by 2025. This has created a renewed sense of urgency and a clear roadmap for collective action.

The global community's commitment to ending child labor is undeniable, but the road ahead is still long and challenging. It requires a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of child labor, strengthens legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms, and promotes universal access to education and social protection. The fight against child labor is not just a matter of law and policy; it is a moral imperative to ensure that every child has the opportunity to enjoy a childhood free from exploitation and to realize their full potential.

## LISTENING SCRIPTS

**Section 1**

**(Sound of a phone ringing)**

**Official:** Good morning, Child Welfare Department, how can I help you?

**Sarah:** Hello, my name is Sarah Keane. I'm calling to report a suspected case of child labor.

**Official:** Okay, Ms. Keane. Can you give me your contact number, please?

**Sarah:** Yes, it's **07700 900582**. (Q1)

**Official:** Thank you. Now, can you tell me the location of the incident?

**Sarah:** It's at a **factory** (Q2) on Park Avenue. I don't know the exact address, but it's a large, old building on the corner of Park Avenue and Green Street.

**Official:** And what kind of business is it?

**Sarah:** It looked like a **garment** (Q3) factory. I saw large rolls of fabric being delivered there this morning.

**Official:** I see. Can you describe the child you saw?

**Sarah:** Yes, he looked to be about **10 or 11** (Q4) years old. Very small for his age.

**Official:** And what were the suspected working hours?

**Sarah:** I've seen him going in at around 7 am and leaving after 8 pm. So he's working more than **12 hours** (Q5) a day, I think.

**Official:** That's a very long day for a child. What was his demeanor like?

**Sarah:** He looked exhausted. Very tired and **unhappy** (Q6). He never smiles or plays like the other children in the neighborhood.

**Official:** Were there any other children present?

**Sarah:** Yes, I've seen at least **two others** (Q7) who look to be around the same age.

**Official:** And what activity did you observe them doing?

**Sarah:** They were **carrying** (Q8) heavy boxes from a truck into the factory.

**Official:** Okay. And when did you last see this happening?

**Sarah:** Just this morning. The date is **October 26th**. (Q9)

**Official:** Thank you for providing all this information, Ms. Keane. What action would you like us to take?

**Sarah:** I'd like you to conduct an **investigation** (Q10) as soon as possible. I'm very worried about those children.

**Official:** We will certainly look into it. Thank you for your call.

**Section 2**

Good morning everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is Tom Hiddleston, and I'm the community outreach coordinator for an organization called **Global Future** (Q11). We're a non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of children around the world. Today, I want to talk to you about a critical issue that affects millions of children: child labor. My goal is not to ask for money or to get you to sign up for anything, but simply to **raise awareness** (Q12) about this complex problem.

Now, you might think that child labor is a thing of the past, something that only happened in Dickensian novels. But the shocking reality is that, according to the latest estimates from the International Labour Organization, there are still 160 million children engaged in child labor worldwide. And what's even more concerning is that this number is no longer falling; in fact, it has seen a slight increase in recent years. (Q13)

Child labor is found in almost every sector of the economy, but the vast majority of it – around 70% – occurs in **agriculture** (Q14). Children are involved in everything from herding livestock to harvesting crops like cocoa and cotton. This work is often hazardous, exposing them to dangerous machinery, sharp tools, and harmful pesticides.

So, what can we do about it? It can feel like an overwhelming problem, but there are concrete actions we can all take. As consumers, we have power. Look for products with certifications that guarantee they are made without child labor. One well-known example is the **'RugMark'** (Q15) certification for carpets and rugs, which ensures that no children were exploited in their production.

On an individual level, your consumer choices can make a difference. (Q16) By choosing to **support fair trade products**, you send a message to companies that you care about ethical sourcing. (A)

But individual action is not enough. We also need to engage in **political advocacy**. (Q17) **Writing to your government officials** and urging them to support laws that require companies to be transparent about their supply chains can have a significant impact. (B)

At the community level, you can get involved by volunteering for a local charity that works with vulnerable families and children. (Q18) This is a great way to make a direct and tangible difference in your own community. (D)

In today's digital age, **online activism** is another powerful tool. (Q19) You can **share information on social media** to raise awareness among your friends and family and encourage them to take action. (E)

Finally, if you are in a position to do so, making **financial contributions** to reputable organizations that run educational programs in developing countries is a highly effective way to help. (Q20) By providing children with access to quality education, we can break the cycle of poverty and give them a brighter future. (C)

Thank you for your time. I hope this has given you some food for thought and inspired you to join the global movement to end child labor.

**Section 3**

**Dr. Evans:** So, David and Maria, you're here to discuss your research papers on child labor. Who would like to start?

**David:** I can, Dr. Evans. I've been looking at the economic causes of child labor, and it's a much more complex issue than I initially thought.

**Maria:** I agree. I was focusing on the psychological effects, but I found I had to understand the context first. I was really surprised to learn that **poverty isn't the only factor**. (Q22) I always assumed it was just about families being poor.

**David:** Exactly. That's the 'supply side' of the equation, which is obviously huge. **Families need the income**, and they see their children as a source of labor. (Q23) But there's also a 'demand side' from employers who want cheap, compliant workers.

**Maria:** And the lack of quality education is a big part of it too. If the local school is underfunded, has unqualified teachers, or is simply too far away, parents might not see the point in sending their children. (Q24) It's a rational choice, in a way.

**Dr. Evans:** That's a very important point, Maria. The 'opportunity cost' of schooling is a key concept. You should also think about the **cultural context**. (Q25) In some societies, there's a long-standing tradition of children learning a trade or working in the family business from a young age. It's not always seen as exploitation.

**David:** I'm also fascinated by the link between child labor and other issues, like **human trafficking**. (Q26) It seems that many children who are trafficked end up in forced labor situations.

**Maria:** Yes, I read about that. For my paper, I think I'm going to focus on **a case study of a specific country**, maybe looking at the cocoa industry in Ghana or the textile industry in Bangladesh. (Q27) I think it would be more manageable than trying to cover everything.

**Dr. Evans:** That's a good idea, Maria. A case study approach will allow you to go into more depth. And David, what about you?

**David:** I'm still trying to narrow it down. I'm interested in the effectiveness of different policy interventions.

**Dr. Evans:** That's a great topic, but you'll need to be specific. I would advise you both to **narrow down your research questions** as much as possible. (Q28) A focused paper is always better than one that tries to do too much.

**Maria:** So, we've agreed that child labor is a **complex issue with no easy answers**. (Q29) It's not just about poverty, but also about education, culture, and the global economy.

**David:** Right. And we need to be careful not to oversimplify it.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. That's a great conclusion to draw from your initial research. So, the next step is for you both to go away and refine your research questions. I want to see your **research proposals** by next Friday. (Q30)

**Maria:** Okay, thank you, Dr. Evans.

**David:** Thanks, Dr. Evans.

**Section 4**

Good morning. In last week's lecture, we discussed the historical context of child labor. Today, I want to move on to a more contemporary issue: the role of **global supply chains** (Q31) in perpetuating child labor in the 21st century.

The products we buy every day – our clothes, our smartphones, our food – have often been on a long journey, passing through many hands and many countries before they reach us. These complex and often opaque supply chains make it incredibly difficult to trace the origin of products and to know for sure whether child labor was involved in their production. Many multinational corporations may be genuinely unaware of child labor in their supply chains, simply because of a lack of **transparency**. (Q32)

Furthermore, the relentless pressure in our globalized economy to reduce costs and maximize profits creates a powerful **demand** (Q33) for cheap labor. In this race to the bottom, it is often the most vulnerable workers, including children, who are exploited.

Let's take the cocoa industry as a case study. It's estimated that over 70% of the world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, primarily in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana. And in this region, child labor is rampant. Children as young as five are involved in hazardous tasks, such as using sharp machetes to harvest cocoa pods and spraying **pesticides** (Q34) without any protective equipment. Many of these children are not even working for their families; they are victims of **trafficking** (Q35) and forced labor, sold to farm owners for a pittance.

In response to public pressure, many companies have developed Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR, policies. They've adopted codes of conduct that prohibit child labor in their supply chains. However, these initiatives are often voluntary and lack effective **monitoring** (Q36) mechanisms. As a result, some critics have argued that CSR is often more about public relations or **'greenwashing'** (Q37) than about bringing about genuine, systemic change.

So, what can be done? There are a number of promising strategies. First, we need stronger government regulation. This includes laws that require companies to conduct due diligence on their supply chains to identify and address child labor risks. A good example of this is the **Modern Slavery Act** (Q38) in the UK, which requires large companies to report on the steps they are taking to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking.

Second, we have certification schemes. Labels like Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance provide consumers with an ethical choice, and they can put pressure on companies to clean up their supply chains. However, the impact of these schemes is often limited by a lack of **consumer awareness**. (Q39)

Finally, technology offers some innovative solutions. Blockchain, for example, can be used to create a digital ledger that tracks a product's journey from farm to shelf, improving **transparency** (Q40) and traceability. By scanning a QR code on a chocolate bar, you could, in theory, see exactly where the cocoa beans came from and who grew them.

In conclusion, eradicating child labor from global supply chains is a monumental task, but it is not an impossible one. It requires a collaborative effort from governments, companies, and, of course, consumers. Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of children between the ages of 5 and 17 involved in child labour across six different global regions in the year 2020.

Overall, Sub-Saharan Africa had by far the highest percentage of child labourers, while Europe and Northern America had the lowest. The figures for the remaining regions were all clustered together at a much lower level.

The most striking feature of the chart is the prevalence of child labour in Sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly a quarter of children (23.9%) were engaged in work. This figure was more than double that of the next highest region, Latin America and the Caribbean, which stood at 8.8%.

The percentages in the other four regions were all below 7%. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia had the third-highest rate at 6.2%, followed closely by Central and Southern Asia at 5.5%. Northern Africa and Western Asia had a slightly lower figure of 4.9%. Finally, the proportion of children in child labour was almost negligible in Europe and Northern America, at just 1.1%. This highlights a stark contrast in the prevalence of this issue between different parts of the world.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

Child labour, the exploitation of children through work that deprives them of their childhood, remains a deeply entrenched global issue despite heightened international scrutiny. This essay will explore the primary drivers of this phenomenon, which are rooted in poverty and systemic social failures, and propose a multi-faceted approach to its resolution, focusing on economic support, education, and corporate accountability.

The principal cause of child labour is undeniably poverty. In households living below the poverty line, survival often necessitates contributions from every family member, including young children. Their meagre earnings, though small, can be critical for the family's subsistence. This is compounded by a lack of social safety nets in many developing nations, meaning that a parent's illness or unemployment can plunge a family into destitution, forcing children into the workforce. Furthermore, inadequate access to quality education presents another significant driver. When schools are unavailable, unaffordable, or of such poor quality that they offer no tangible path to a better future, the perceived value of education diminishes. In such circumstances, sending a child to work can appear to be a more pragmatic, albeit short-sighted, choice for struggling parents.

To effectively address the complex issue of child labour, a comprehensive set of solutions is required. Firstly, governments and international bodies must prioritize poverty reduction. This involves creating decent work for adults, establishing robust social protection systems, and implementing cash transfer programs that provide direct financial support to vulnerable families, conditional on their children attending school. Secondly, investing in education is paramount. This means not only building more schools but also ensuring they are free, accessible, and provide a high-quality learning environment with well-trained teachers. When education is seen as a genuine route out of poverty, parents are far more likely to keep their children in the classroom.

Finally, the role of the corporate world cannot be overstated. Multinational corporations have a moral and social responsibility to ensure their global supply chains are free from child labour. This requires more than just voluntary codes of conduct; it demands stringent government regulation, a such as mandatory due diligence laws, which compel companies to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights abuses in their operations. Greater transparency, facilitated by technologies like blockchain, and stronger consumer-led campaigns for ethically sourced products can also exert significant pressure on businesses to reform their practices.

In conclusion, while child labour is a multifaceted problem with deep-seated causes, it is not insurmountable. A concerted effort that tackles poverty, strengthens educational systems, and enforces corporate accountability can create a world where children are free to learn, play, and build a future for themselves, rather than being trapped in a cycle of exploitation.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

I remember a time a few years ago when I was on holiday in a developing country in Southeast Asia. I was walking through a busy market in the capital city, and I saw a young boy, who couldn't have been more than seven or eight years old, weaving through the crowds selling packets of tissues. He was tiny and was carrying a large, heavy-looking bag filled with his wares.

He approached me and held out the tissues, and I just felt this overwhelming sense of sadness and helplessness. He had such a serious expression on his face, and his eyes looked so tired. It was the middle of the day, a time when he should have been in school or playing with friends, but instead, he was working to survive. I bought some tissues from him, more out of a desire to help in some small way than because I actually needed them. He just took the money, nodded, and moved on to the next potential customer without a word.

Seeing him really brought home the reality of child labour for me. It's one thing to read about it in articles or see it on the news, but it's another thing entirely to see it with your own eyes. It made me think about the gross inequality in the world and how the circumstances of your birth can have such a profound impact on your life chances. I believe that every child has the right to a childhood, to an education, and to be protected from exploitation. Forcing a child to work robs them of all of those things and traps them in a cycle of poverty. It's a complex problem, and I know there are no easy solutions, but seeing that little boy in the market solidified my belief that we have a collective responsibility to fight for a world where no child is forced to sacrifice their future for the sake of survival.
