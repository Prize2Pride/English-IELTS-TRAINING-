**The Ascent of Veganism: A Journey Through Time and Principle**

The term ‘veganism’, coined in 1944, may seem like a modern invention, but the principles it represents are deeply rooted in history, stretching back thousands of years. At its core, veganism is a philosophy and way of life that seeks to exclude all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose. This commitment distinguishes it from vegetarianism, which primarily involves abstaining from meat. While many adopt a vegan diet for health or environmental reasons, the movement's historical foundation is overwhelmingly ethical.

Evidence of individuals choosing to avoid animal products can be traced to ancient civilisations. As early as 500 BCE, the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras advocated for a meatless diet, based on his belief in the transmigration of souls between humans and animals. His followers, the Pythagoreans, adopted a similar diet. In ancient India, the principle of *ahimsa*, or non-violence towards all living beings, was a central tenet of religions like Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, leading many to adopt vegetarian or vegan-like diets. One of the earliest documented vegans was the blind Syrian poet Al-Ma'arri (c. 973–1057), who argued that if humans deserve justice, so do animals, and abstained from all animal products out of compassion.

The 19th century witnessed the formal organisation of the vegetarian movement in Great Britain and the United States. Within this growing community, a minority argued for the complete avoidance of all animal products. In 1813, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published *A Vindication of Natural Diet*, arguing for abstinence from animal food. A few years later, Dr. William Lambe, a London physician, contended that a diet of only water and vegetables could cure a range of illnesses, asserting that “milk eating and flesh-eating are but branches of a common system and they must stand or fall together.” This period also saw the establishment of vegan communities, such as Fruitlands, a transcendentalist commune founded in Massachusetts in 1844 by Amos Bronson Alcott, which mandated a diet free from all animal products.

Despite this long history, the movement lacked a distinct identity until the mid-20th century. The term ‘vegan’ was created in November 1944 by Donald Watson, a British woodworker and secretary of the Leicester Vegetarian Society. Frustrated by the Vegetarian Society's refusal to dedicate a space in its newsletter to non-dairy vegetarianism, Watson and a small group of like-minded individuals decided to form their own movement. They combined the first three and last two letters of ‘vegetarian’ to create ‘vegan’, which Watson described as marking “the beginning and end of vegetarian.” The new Vegan Society published its own newsletter, *The Vegan News*, and established a formal definition of veganism that extended beyond diet to encompass a broader ethical framework against animal exploitation.

The philosophy underpinning ethical veganism is the rejection of speciesism—the idea that human beings are superior to other animals and thus have the right to use them as resources. Vegans argue that animals are sentient beings with their own right to life and freedom, and that using them for food, clothing, entertainment, or research is a form of injustice. The Vegan Society’s formal definition reflects this, stating that veganism “is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals.” This principle of practicability acknowledges the complexities of living in a non-vegan world, but the core motivation remains the abolition of animal use.

From the philosophical musings of ancient Greeks to the organised activism of the 20th century, veganism has evolved from a fringe idea to a mainstream global movement. Its journey reflects a growing consciousness about the ethical implications of our dietary and lifestyle choices. While the term itself is relatively new, the compassionate spirit that drives it is as old as human civilisation itself, continually challenging us to reconsider our relationship with the animal kingdom.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Planetary Plate: Veganism and its Environmental Ripple Effect**

**A**
The global food system is a colossal force, shaping not only our health but the very health of our planet. It is responsible for approximately one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions, a primary driver of climate change. Furthermore, it consumes 70% of the world's freshwater and is the leading cause of water pollution in our rivers and lakes. With agriculture occupying nearly three-quarters of the Earth's habitable land, the link between our dietary choices and environmental degradation is undeniable. The relentless expansion of farmland, particularly for livestock, is a major contributor to deforestation and the catastrophic loss of biodiversity.

**B**
In the search for sustainable solutions, the spotlight has increasingly turned to plant-based diets. A landmark 2023 study published in the journal *Nature Food* has provided the most comprehensive analysis to date on the environmental footprint of different dietary patterns. By examining the real-world diets of 55,000 individuals in the UK and cross-referencing them with data from 38,000 farms across 119 countries, researchers have painted a starkly clear picture. The findings are dramatic: a vegan diet results in 75% less climate-heating emissions, 75% less land use, and 54% less water consumption compared to a diet high in meat (over 100g per day).

**C**
The impact on biodiversity is equally profound. The study revealed that vegan diets lead to a 66% reduction in wildlife destruction. This is largely because plant-based agriculture is far more land-efficient than raising livestock. A significant portion of global crop production is not for direct human consumption but is used to feed farm animals. By choosing to eat plants directly, we drastically reduce the overall demand for agricultural land, allowing more space for natural habitats to recover and thrive.

**D**
One of the most significant environmental advantages of a vegan diet lies in its effect on methane emissions. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with a warming potential more than 80 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Livestock, particularly cattle and sheep, are major producers of methane through their digestive processes. The research highlighted that vegan diets were associated with a staggering 93% reduction in methane emissions when compared to high-meat diets. This single factor represents a powerful tool in the global effort to mitigate the most immediate impacts of climate change.

**E**
While the benefits are clear, the study also revealed an interesting nuance. The environmental impacts of low-meat (less than 50g per day), pescetarian, and vegetarian diets were relatively similar. While all showed a significant improvement over high-meat diets, the most substantial leap in environmental benefit was seen when transitioning to a fully vegan diet. This suggests that while reducing meat consumption is a positive step, the exclusion of all animal products, including dairy and eggs, delivers the most profound and comprehensive environmental advantages.

**F**
The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that dietary change is not just a personal choice but a planetary imperative. Experts, including the UK's Climate Change Committee, have reinforced the message that shifting away from animal-based foods is crucial for meeting national and global climate targets. While technological innovations and reductions in food waste are important components of a sustainable food system, they are insufficient on their own. A radical reduction in the consumption of meat and dairy in affluent nations is an essential, and perhaps the most impactful, step individuals can take to lighten their environmental footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future for all.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Vegan Plate: A Guide to Navigating Nutritional Needs**

A well-planned vegan diet is associated with a plethora of health benefits and is considered appropriate for all stages of life. Major dietary expert organizations around the world agree that a balanced vegan diet can provide all the necessary nutrients for optimal health. Research has consistently shown that individuals following a plant-based diet tend to have lower body mass indexes (BMIs), reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The benefits stem from a higher intake of fibre, antioxidants, and phytochemicals found in plant foods, and a lower intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.

However, the key to a healthy vegan diet lies in the phrase “well-planned.” Removing all animal products from one’s diet requires careful attention to ensure that all nutritional needs are met. While a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes is inherently healthy, there are specific micronutrients that are less abundant in plant-based sources and require conscious effort to obtain. Failing to account for these can lead to deficiencies that may negate the diet's potential benefits and, in some cases, cause significant health problems.

One of the most critical nutrients for vegans to be mindful of is Vitamin B12. This vitamin is essential for nerve function and the formation of red blood cells. It is produced by microorganisms and is not naturally found in plant foods. While some plant-based milks and cereals are fortified with B12, the most reliable sources for vegans are fortified foods and supplements. A B12 deficiency can lead to serious and irreversible neurological damage, making it a non-negotiable component of a healthy vegan diet.

Iron is another nutrient that requires careful planning. There are two forms of dietary iron: heme iron, found in animal products, and non-heme iron, found in plants. Non-heme iron is not as readily absorbed by the body. However, its absorption can be significantly enhanced by consuming it with foods rich in Vitamin C. Excellent plant sources of iron include lentils, chickpeas, beans, tofu, and fortified cereals. By pairing these with foods like oranges, bell peppers, or broccoli, vegans can effectively meet their iron requirements and prevent iron-deficiency anaemia.

Calcium, crucial for bone health, is another point of focus. While dairy is a well-known source, there are numerous plant-based foods rich in this mineral. Fortified plant milks and yogurts, calcium-set tofu, and green leafy vegetables like kale and bok choy are excellent sources. It is also important to ensure adequate Vitamin D intake, as it plays a vital role in calcium absorption. Vitamin D is synthesized by the body through sun exposure, but in many parts of the world, especially during winter months, fortified foods or a supplement are necessary to maintain adequate levels.

Finally, obtaining sufficient omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA which are important for brain health, can be a challenge. These are primarily found in fatty fish. The plant-based omega-3, ALA, is found in flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, but the body's conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA is inefficient. Therefore, many experts recommend that vegans consider a microalgae-based supplement, which provides a direct source of DHA and EPA, to ensure they are meeting their needs for these essential fats.

In conclusion, while a vegan diet offers significant health advantages, it is not a magic bullet. A successful vegan lifestyle requires a conscious and informed approach to nutrition. By understanding the potential pitfalls and planning meals to include a variety of nutrient-dense foods and reliable supplements where necessary, individuals can thrive on a plant-based diet and reap its many rewards for a lifetime of health.

**(Sound of a phone ringing)**

**Mark:** Hello, Northwood Community Society, Mark speaking. How can I help you?

**Sarah:** Oh, hello. I’m calling about the Vegan Potluck event I saw advertised in the local library. I was hoping you could give me a few more details.

**Mark:** Of course. I have the details right here. This is our first time running one, so we’re very excited. It’s on Saturday, **October** 28th. (Q1)

**Sarah:** October 28th, great. And what time does it start?

**Mark:** It runs from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and it’s being held at the Northwood Community **Centre**. (Q2) That’s on Applewood Lane, number 14.

**Sarah:** Perfect. I think I know where that is. My name is Sarah, by the way.

**Mark:** Nice to meet you, Sarah. Can I take your details for the booking? Your full name?

**Sarah:** Yes, it’s Sarah **Jenkins**. (Q3) That’s J-E-N-K-I-N-S.

**Mark:** Got it. And a contact number?

**Mark:** Excellent. So, just so you know, the theme for the potluck is International Dishes. We’re hoping to get a good variety. You just need to bring a vegan dish that can be shared among about six people.

**Sarah:** That sounds fun. I’m thinking of making a lentil curry.

**Mark:** A lentil curry, lovely. One very important thing is that you must bring a small card with your dish that lists all the **ingredients**. (Q5) This is crucial for people with allergies.

**Sarah:** That’s a very good idea. I’ll be sure to do that. Will plates and cutlery be provided?

**Mark:** Yes, everything will be provided. We’ll also have a range of drinks. There’s just a small charge of **£5** (Q6) per person. That’s to cover the cost of the hall rental.

**Sarah:** That’s perfectly reasonable. I’ve just moved to the area, so I’m looking forward to meeting some new people. I’m a fairly **recent** (Q7) vegan, so I’m still learning!

**Mark:** Well, this is the perfect place to come! You’ll get lots of ideas. You said you’re making a **lentil** (Q8) curry? That sounds delicious.

**Sarah:** I hope so! I also saw on the flyer that you have a book club?

**Mark:** Yes, we do! Our monthly **book** (Q9) club is very popular. We focus on books related to food, sustainability, and ethics. The next meeting is actually next Tuesday at the Green Leaf Cafe.

**Sarah:** Oh, where’s that?

**Sarah:** I think I will! Thanks so much for your help.

**Mark:** You’re very welcome. We’ll see you on the 28th.

**SECTION 2**

Hello everyone, and welcome to this introductory session on transitioning to a plant-based diet. My name is Dr. Anya Sharma, and I’m a nutritionist who has specialised in plant-based eating for over fifteen years. It’s wonderful to see so many people interested in this topic.

People come to a plant-based diet for many reasons. While animal welfare is a significant factor for many, and environmental concerns are a rapidly growing motivation, the vast majority of people I consult with are initially drawn to it for the powerful benefits to their **personal health**. (Q11) And the science certainly backs this up.

Now, starting this journey can feel overwhelming, so my goal today is to give you some practical, simple steps. A common pitfall I see is people simply removing animal products but not replacing them with the right things. They end up eating a lot of plain pasta or processed vegan junk food. While these are fine in moderation, relying on them is a big mistake as they lack the nutrients you need. The key is variety. (Q12)

So, where do you start? I’m a big fan of the ‘crowding out’ method. Instead of thinking about what you have to *remove*, focus on what you can *add*. Start by consciously adding more plant-based meals into your week. Don’t go home and throw everything out. Just aim to have one fully plant-based day a week, or start by making your breakfasts and lunches vegan. This gradual approach is much more sustainable. (Q13)

One of the first questions I’m always asked is, “But what about protein?” It’s a valid concern, but it’s easier to manage than you think. The simple rule is to try and include a good source of plant-based protein with every meal. This could be lentils, beans, chickpeas, tofu, tempeh, or quinoa. You don’t need to obsess over grams, just make sure a portion is on your plate at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (Q14)

Finally, let’s talk about the social aspect, which can be a real challenge. My advice is to be prepared. If you’re going to a friend’s house, offer to bring a dish to share. If you’re eating out, look at the menu online beforehand. A quick phone call to the restaurant can also put your mind at ease. Clear communication with friends and family is key; explain your choices calmly and positively. (Q15)

Now, let’s touch on a few key nutrients that require a little extra attention. These are the ones you need to be mindful of to ensure your diet is balanced and you stay healthy in the long term.

First, Vitamin B12. This is the only nutrient you absolutely cannot get reliably from a vegan diet. It’s not made by plants or animals, but by bacteria. You must **take a daily supplement**. This is non-negotiable for long-term health. (Q16)

Next is Calcium. We all know it’s vital for bone health. While it’s present in leafy greens, the best and most reliable way to get enough is to **consume fortified plant milks** and yogurts. Many brands now have as much, or even more, calcium than dairy milk. (Q17)

Then there’s Iron. Plant-based iron, or non-heme iron, isn’t absorbed as easily as the iron from meat. The trick is to **combine it with a source of Vitamin C**, which dramatically increases absorption. So, have a glass of orange juice with your fortified cereal, or squeeze lemon juice over your lentil salad. (Q18)

Omega-3 fatty acids are also important, especially for brain health. While you can get the basic form, ALA, from flax and chia seeds, the most useful forms, EPA and DHA, are harder to come by. For this reason, many nutritionists, including myself, recommend a microalgae supplement. However, for the purpose of this general guide, simply ensuring you have a daily source of ALA, which is **found in most nuts and seeds**, is a great start. (Q19)

Lastly, Vitamin K. This is one you don’t need to worry about! It’s abundant in leafy greens and a wide range of other plant foods. If you are eating a varied diet with plenty of colourful vegetables, you will get more than enough. It’s **easily obtained from a balanced diet**. (Q20)

So, to summarise…

**(fade out)**

**SECTION 3**

**Tutor:** Okay Leo and Chloe, thanks for coming in. You’re presenting your research on the economics of veganism next week. How are you getting on?

**Chloe:** We’re making good progress, Dr. Evans. We’ve gathered a lot of data. We initially planned to focus on the history of the vegan food industry, but we found the recent market trends so interesting that we decided to make that the main section of our presentation.

**Leo:** Right. So we’re now focusing on **the economic impact of the plant-based market**. (Q21) It’s just exploded in the last five years.

**Tutor:** That’s a good decision. It’s a very current topic. So, what are your key findings?

**Chloe:** Well, one of the most significant things is that the growth isn’t primarily being driven by people who identify as 100% vegan. The real economic power comes from the huge number of **‘flexitarians’ – people who are consciously and actively reducing their meat consumption**. (Q22) They might buy a plant-based burger one day and a chicken breast the next. They’re the demographic the big companies are really targeting.

**Leo:** Exactly. And that leads to one of the biggest hurdles for the industry, which is cost. The holy grail for these plant-based meat companies is **achieving price parity with conventional meat**. (Q23) At the moment, many of the products are still significantly more expensive, which is a barrier for many consumers. Getting the price down is their number one challenge.

**Tutor:** That’s a very important point. What about the other side of the coin? The traditional industries?

**Chloe:** It’s been fascinating. The dairy industry, for example, has been hit hard by the popularity of oat, soy, and almond milk. But what’s interesting is that instead of just fighting it, many of the major dairy corporations are now **investing heavily in their own plant-based products**. (Q24) They’re buying up plant-based cheese companies and launching their own vegan milk lines. They’re adapting to survive.

**Leo:** And we realised the ‘vegan economy’ is much broader than just food. We found reports on the growth of vegan-friendly travel, for instance – hotels and tour companies that cater specifically to vegans. So it’s spilling over into **the wellness and tourism industries**, which is another angle we want to explore. (Q25)

**Tutor:** That’s a great insight. It shows you’re thinking about the wider context. What has surprised you most during your research?

**Leo:** For me, it was looking at the job market. You see all these new and interesting positions being created. I mean, I came across a job advert for a ‘food futurologist’ at a plant-based tech company. It’s not just about food science; it’s about predicting social trends. **The emergence of new roles like that** was something I hadn’t expected at all. (Q26)

**Chloe:** I think for me, the main concern that came up is the risk of the movement losing its way as it becomes more commercialised. When you have giant multinational corporations entering the space, there’s a danger of **a loss of focus on the original ethical message**. (Q27) It becomes more about profit and less about animal welfare or sustainability. That’s a tension we want to discuss.

**Tutor:** An excellent point. And what about the future of farming itself?

**Leo:** We looked at that. It’s unlikely that livestock farming will vanish, but we might see a major shift. Some reports suggest a move towards **smaller-scale, more sustainable models** that coexist with the growing plant-based industry, rather than the huge factory farms we see today. (Q28)

**Chloe:** And that’s linked to government policy. We found that at present, government subsidies overwhelmingly **favour the meat and dairy industries**. (Q29) There are calls to reform this to create a more level playing field and support farmers who want to transition to plant-based agriculture.

**Tutor:** This is all excellent. You have some really strong, well-researched points. So, what’s your plan for the next few days?

**Leo:** We’ve gathered the information, so the next step is to structure it. We’re going to **write our presentation slides** (Q30) and decide who is going to talk about which section.

**Tutor:** Sounds like a solid plan. I look forward to seeing the presentation.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to explore a topic that sounds like science fiction but is rapidly becoming a reality: the future of food, and specifically, the field of cellular agriculture.

As we’ve discussed previously, our system of traditional livestock farming is facing a crisis of sustainability. The environmental and ethical costs are immense. Broadly speaking, two major solutions are emerging. The first is the widespread adoption of plant-based diets. The second, which we will focus on today, is cellular agriculture. In simple terms, this means producing animal products like meat and dairy, but from cell **cultures** (Q31) rather than from whole, living animals.

Let’s first look at the most well-known application: cultivated meat, which you may have heard referred to as ‘lab-grown’ meat. The process begins with a small sample of cells taken from an animal – for example, a cow or a chicken. This can be done with a simple biopsy, and it is completely **painless**. (Q32) These cells are then placed in a large stainless-steel tank called a bioreactor, or cultivator. Inside, they are fed a warm, nutrient-rich liquid – a sort of soup containing everything the cells need to grow. The cells then do what they do naturally: they multiply, and then they differentiate into the types of cells we eat, primarily muscle and fat. This mass of tissue is then harvested and can be formed into familiar shapes like a burger or a chicken nugget.

The potential benefits are enormous. Environmentally, studies predict it could use up to 99% less land, 96% less water, and produce 96% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional meat. Ethically, it completely eliminates the need for animal slaughter. And from a health perspective, it can be produced in a completely sterile environment, meaning it’s free from the **pathogens** (Q33) like Salmonella or E. coli that are a constant concern in factory farming. It also means there’s no need for antibiotics.

However, the challenges are equally huge. The primary one is cost. While the price has plummeted from hundreds of thousands of dollars per burger to just a few dollars, it’s still not competitive with conventional meat. The second challenge is scale. Moving from producing small amounts in a lab to full, industrial-level production is a massive engineering **hurdle**. (Q34) Then there’s regulation – getting approval from food safety agencies is a long and complex process. And finally, public acceptance. There’s a natural skepticism that needs to be overcome.

Now, a second, and perhaps more immediately viable, branch of cellular agriculture is precision fermentation. This isn’t as new as you might think; we’ve used a form of it for decades to make insulin for diabetics. The process uses microorganisms, like yeast, as tiny ‘factories’. Scientists give these microbes the genetic **code** (Q35) to produce a specific animal protein. For example, you can give yeast the blueprint for casein and whey, the proteins that make milk into cheese. The microbes are then fermented in large tanks, and they produce vast quantities of the target protein, which is then filtered and purified. This technology can be used to make real dairy cheese without cows, or real egg whites without chickens. It’s also being used to create other things like collagen for cosmetics, or **gelatin** (Q36) for sweets, all without using animals.

So, what is the relationship between these new technologies and the vegan movement? It’s complex. There’s a significant **debate** (Q37) within the community. On one hand, many vegans and animal rights advocates are hugely supportive. They see it as a pragmatic way to achieve their ultimate goal: ending animal slaughter and exploitation. They argue it’s a more realistic path for the mass population than expecting everyone to adopt a wholly plant-based diet.

On the other hand, some are opposed. They argue that because the process for cultivated meat starts with a cell from a living animal, it can never be truly ‘vegan’. Others are concerned that it reinforces the idea that eating meat is a **desireable** (Q38) or necessary act, rather than challenging that notion itself. There are also valid concerns about the potential for a few large corporations to gain even more control over our food supply.

In conclusion, cellular agriculture is not a ‘silver bullet’ that will solve all our food problems overnight. It is, however, a hugely promising field. It’s likely to be part of a **mosaic** (Q39) of solutions for feeding the world sustainably. The future of protein will probably be a mix: a greater reliance on plant-based foods, the introduction of cultivated and fermented products, and hopefully, a reformed, much smaller-scale and more humane animal agriculture sector. The key goal, shared by all these approaches, is the overall **reduction** (Q40) in our reliance on the destructive system of industrial animal farming.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the changes in the average weekly consumption of four different protein sources—Beef, Chicken, Fish, and Plant-Based options—in a particular European country between 2005 and 2025.

Overall, the chart indicates a significant shift in dietary preferences over the 20-year period. There was a dramatic increase in the consumption of plant-based proteins and a moderate rise for chicken, while the consumption of beef and fish saw a notable decline.

In 2005, beef was the most popular protein source, with an average weekly consumption of 500 grams per person. However, by 2025, this figure had halved to just 250 grams. Similarly, fish consumption decreased from 150 grams to 100 grams per week. In contrast, chicken consumption saw a modest increase, rising from 300 grams in 2005 to become the most consumed protein source at 350 grams in 2025.

The most striking trend was the exponential growth in the popularity of plant-based protein. Starting from a mere 50 grams per week in 2005, consumption skyrocketed to 300 grams by 2025, a six-fold increase. This made it the second most popular protein source, surpassing both beef and fish.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9)

The debate over the role of government in shaping public dietary habits, particularly concerning the promotion of plant-based eating, is becoming increasingly prominent. While some advocate for active state intervention to address pressing environmental and health crises, others staunchly defend the principle of individual autonomy in food choices. This essay will examine both perspectives before arguing that a balanced approach of governmental encouragement, rather than enforcement, is the most prudent path forward.

On one hand, the argument for government promotion of plant-based diets is compelling and rooted in significant global challenges. The environmental case is perhaps the most urgent. Industrial animal agriculture is a leading driver of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and water pollution. By incentivising a shift towards plant-based foods, governments could make substantial progress towards meeting climate targets and preserving biodiversity. Furthermore, from a public health standpoint, diets high in red and processed meats are linked to a higher incidence of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. A government-led campaign to encourage plant-based eating could, therefore, reduce the strain on healthcare systems and improve national well-being, much like public health campaigns against smoking or excessive sugar consumption.

Conversely, the principle of personal choice is a cornerstone of liberal democracies. Critics of government intervention argue that what an individual chooses to eat is a private matter, and that state interference amounts to an overreach of authority. They contend that as long as a food product is safe for consumption, the government has no right to favour one dietary pattern over another. This perspective emphasizes individual liberty and the right to follow cultural or personal traditions related to food. Moreover, there is a concern that such policies could disproportionately affect farmers and those employed in the livestock industry, necessitating a complex and potentially costly economic transition.

In my opinion, while the state should not mandate dietary choices, it has a clear responsibility to guide its citizens towards healthier and more sustainable options. This does not require banning meat but rather rebalancing the existing system. Governments could, for instance, reform agricultural subsidies that currently favour meat and dairy production, and instead support farmers transitioning to plant-based agriculture. Public information campaigns, clearer environmental and health labelling on food products, and support for innovation in plant-based technology are all legitimate and non-coercive tools. By making the plant-based option easier, more affordable, and more appealing, governments can empower individuals to make better choices for themselves and the planet, without infringing upon their fundamental freedoms.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

(Examiner: Describe a meal you had that was particularly memorable. You have one to two minutes for this. Don’t worry if I stop you. You can start speaking now.)

Certainly. I’d like to talk about a meal I had a couple of years ago that was incredibly memorable, not just for the food itself, but for the whole experience. It was at a small, family-run restaurant in a coastal town in Italy, during a summer holiday.

The meal itself was surprisingly simple. It was a seafood pasta – linguine with clams, to be precise. What made it so special was the freshness of the ingredients. The restaurant was right on the harbour, and you could tell the clams had been brought in that very morning. The pasta was clearly handmade, and the sauce was just a light, fragrant mix of white wine, garlic, parsley, and a hint of chilli. It wasn’t a heavy or complicated dish, but the quality was just on another level compared to anything I’d had before.

I was there with my partner. We had spent the day exploring the coastline and stumbled upon this little place by chance as the sun was setting. It was a warm evening in late August, and we were lucky enough to get a table right at the water's edge. The atmosphere was just perfect – very relaxed and authentic.

The reason this meal stands out so vividly in my memory is because it felt like a perfect moment. It was the combination of everything: the delicious, unpretentious food, the beautiful seaside location, the warm weather, and sharing it with someone special. It was one of those times where you feel completely content and happy. It wasn’t just about eating; it was about experiencing a place and a culture. That simple plate of pasta really captured the essence of an Italian summer for me, and that’s why I’ll never forget it.
