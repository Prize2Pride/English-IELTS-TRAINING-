### Passage 1: The Four Pillars of Food Security

The concept of food security is a complex one, with multiple dimensions that must be considered to ensure that all people, at all times, have access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food. The most widely accepted framework for understanding food security is based on four key pillars: availability, access, utilization, and stability. This framework, first articulated at the 1996 World Food Summit, provides a comprehensive lens through which to analyze and address the challenges of feeding a growing global population.

The first pillar, **availability**, refers to the physical supply of food. This is the most basic component of food security, as it is impossible for people to be food secure if there is simply not enough food to go around. Food availability is determined by a combination of factors, including domestic production, international trade, and food aid. A country's agricultural productivity, its ability to import food from other countries, and the effectiveness of its food distribution systems all play a role in ensuring that there is a sufficient quantity of food available for its population. However, the mere presence of food in a country does not guarantee that everyone will have access to it.

This brings us to the second pillar, **access**, which encompasses both physical and economic access to food. Even if a country has an adequate supply of food, individuals and households may still be food insecure if they are unable to obtain it. Economic access is determined by factors such as income, employment, and food prices. If food is too expensive, or if people do not have the financial resources to purchase it, they will not be able to meet their dietary needs. Physical access, on the other hand, is related to the infrastructure and logistics of food distribution. In remote or conflict-affected areas, for example, people may have difficulty accessing markets or receiving food aid, even if it is available elsewhere in the country.

The third pillar, **utilization**, refers to the way in which the body is able to make use of the nutrients in food. This is a more nuanced aspect of food security, as it goes beyond simply having enough food to eat. Proper utilization of food requires a diverse diet that provides a range of essential nutrients, as well as access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. If people are consuming a diet that is high in calories but low in micronutrients, they may still suffer from malnutrition, even if they are not technically hungry. Similarly, if people are sick or have a disease that prevents them from properly absorbing nutrients, their food security will be compromised.

Finally, the fourth pillar, **stability**, refers to the ability to maintain food security over time. This means that people should not have to live in fear of losing their access to food due to sudden shocks or cyclical events. These shocks can be caused by a variety of factors, including natural disasters, economic crises, and political instability. For example, a drought or flood can decimate crops and lead to a sudden drop in food availability. A sharp increase in food prices can make it impossible for poor households to afford food. And a conflict or civil war can disrupt food production and distribution systems, leading to widespread food insecurity. To ensure stability, it is essential to build resilient food systems that are able to withstand these shocks and to have social safety nets in place to protect the most vulnerable members of society.

In conclusion, food security is a multifaceted issue that requires a holistic approach. By addressing all four pillars of availability, access, utilization, and stability, we can work towards a world where everyone has the ability to live a healthy and productive life.

### Passage 2: The Global Food Security Challenge

**A**

The world faces a daunting challenge in the 21st century: how to ensure that a growing global population, projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, has access to a safe, nutritious, and sufficient supply of food. This challenge is compounded by a host of interconnected factors, including climate change, conflict, economic inequality, and environmental degradation. Addressing the issue of food security requires a multifaceted approach that tackles these root causes and promotes sustainable and resilient food systems.

**B**

Climate change is perhaps the most significant threat to global food security. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, are having a devastating impact on agricultural production around the world. In many regions, traditional farming practices are no longer viable, and farmers are struggling to adapt to the new and unpredictable climatic conditions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that for every degree of warming, global wheat yields are projected to decline by 6%, and maize yields by 7.4%.

**C**

Conflict and political instability are also major drivers of food insecurity. War and civil unrest disrupt food production and distribution systems, displace populations, and destroy infrastructure. In conflict-affected areas, people are often forced to flee their homes and abandon their farms, leading to a collapse in local food production. Furthermore, humanitarian access to conflict zones is often restricted, making it difficult to deliver food aid to those who need it most. According to the World Food Programme, conflict is the primary driver of hunger for 85 million people in 22 countries.

**D**

Economic inequality plays a crucial role in determining who has access to food and who does not. Even in countries where there is an abundance of food, millions of people go hungry because they simply cannot afford to buy it. The poorest and most marginalized members of society are often the most vulnerable to food insecurity, as they have limited access to land, credit, and other resources. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, with millions of people losing their jobs and livelihoods, and being pushed into poverty and hunger.

**E**

Environmental degradation is another significant challenge to food security. Decades of unsustainable agricultural practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing, and the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, have led to soil erosion, water scarcity, and a loss of biodiversity. These trends are undermining the long-term productivity of our food systems and making them more vulnerable to shocks. It is estimated that 52% of the world's agricultural land is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation.

**F**

Addressing the global food security challenge will require a concerted effort from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. This includes investing in climate-resilient agriculture, promoting sustainable land and water management practices, and strengthening social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. It also means addressing the root causes of conflict and inequality, and working to create a more just and equitable world. The future of our planet and its people depends on our ability to rise to this challenge.

### Passage 3: Innovating for a Food-Secure Future

As the global community grapples with the monumental task of feeding a burgeoning population in the face of climate change and resource scarcity, innovation has emerged as a critical component of the solution. From high-tech farming techniques to novel approaches to reducing food waste, a wave of ingenuity is sweeping across the agricultural landscape, offering hope for a more food-secure future. While no single innovation can be a panacea, a combination of these approaches holds the potential to revolutionize the way we produce, distribute, and consume food.

One of the most promising areas of innovation is precision agriculture, which leverages technology to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. By using GPS, sensors, and data analytics, farmers can tailor their inputs, such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides, to the specific needs of each plant. This not only increases efficiency and productivity but also minimizes the environmental impact of farming. For example, precision irrigation systems can reduce water consumption by up to 50%, a crucial advantage in water-scarce regions. Similarly, targeted pesticide application can reduce chemical runoff and protect biodiversity.

Another exciting development is the rise of vertical farming, which involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in controlled indoor environments. This method of farming offers a number of advantages over traditional agriculture. Because the environment is controlled, crops can be grown year-round, regardless of the weather outside. Vertical farms also use significantly less land and water than conventional farms, and because they can be located in urban areas, they can reduce transportation costs and provide fresh, local produce to city dwellers. However, the high energy costs associated with lighting and climate control remain a significant challenge for the widespread adoption of this technology.

Genetic modification (GM) is another tool that has the potential to enhance food security, though it remains a subject of considerable debate. Proponents of GM technology argue that it can be used to develop crops that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and drought, as well as crops that are more nutritious. For example, Golden Rice, a genetically modified variety of rice that is rich in beta-carotene, has the potential to prevent vitamin A deficiency in millions of children around the world. However, critics raise concerns about the potential long-term health and environmental impacts of GM crops, and many countries have strict regulations on their cultivation and sale.

In addition to these technological innovations, there is also a growing movement to address the issue of food waste. It is estimated that one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted each year, a staggering amount that could feed billions of people. Efforts to reduce food waste are taking place at all stages of the food supply chain, from farm to fork. These include improving harvesting and storage techniques, redistributing surplus food to those in need, and raising consumer awareness about the importance of reducing household food waste. By tackling this issue, we can make our food systems more efficient and sustainable, and ensure that the food we produce reaches those who need it most.

Ultimately, creating a food-secure future will require a multi-pronged approach that embraces innovation in all its forms. By combining the power of technology with a commitment to sustainability and social equity, we can build a food system that is resilient, productive, and able to nourish a growing world population for generations to come.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the global population that experienced moderate to severe food insecurity across different regions in the year 2022. Overall, Africa had the highest percentage of food insecurity, while Northern America and Europe had the lowest. The world average for food insecurity stood at just under 30%.

Africa was the region most affected by food insecurity, with a significant 57.9% of its population facing this issue. This figure was nearly double the world average. Latin America and the Caribbean also experienced a high level of food insecurity, with 37.5% of its population affected, which was also considerably above the global average.

In contrast, Northern America and Europe had the lowest rate of food insecurity, at only 8.0%. Oceania’s figure was slightly higher, at 13.1%. Asia’s percentage of food insecurity was 24.2%, which was below the world average but still represented a significant number of people.

In summary, the chart reveals a stark contrast in the prevalence of food insecurity across different regions of the world, with Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean being the most affected, and the developed regions of Northern America and Europe being the least affected.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9)

The question of how to ensure food security for a rapidly growing global population is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. There are two main schools of thought on this issue: one that champions technology as the ultimate solution, and another that advocates for a return to more sustainable, small-scale farming practices. This essay will discuss both of these views before offering a concluding perspective.

On the one hand, proponents of a technology-driven approach argue that innovation is essential to meet the world’s growing demand for food. They point to the transformative potential of technologies such as precision agriculture, genetic modification, and vertical farming. Precision agriculture, for example, uses data and technology to optimize the use of resources, leading to higher yields and reduced environmental impact. Similarly, genetically modified crops can be engineered to be more resistant to pests, diseases, and drought, thereby increasing the resilience of our food systems. While these technologies are not without their critics, they undoubtedly have the potential to play a crucial role in feeding a world of 10 billion people.

On the other hand, there is a growing movement that is critical of our industrialized food system and advocates for a shift towards more sustainable, small-scale farming. Adherents of this view argue that the current model of agriculture is environmentally unsustainable, socially inequitable, and detrimental to human health. They contend that a focus on local, organic, and agroecological farming methods can not only produce healthy and nutritious food but also restore ecosystems, build community resilience, and create a more just and equitable food system. They believe that the solution to food insecurity lies not in producing more food, but in producing it differently.

In my opinion, both of these perspectives have merit, and a false dichotomy between technology and sustainability is unhelpful. The reality is that we will need a combination of both approaches to create a food-secure future. We need to harness the power of technology to increase food production and efficiency, but we must do so in a way that is environmentally sustainable and socially just. This means investing in research and development to create climate-resilient crops and resource-efficient farming systems. It also means supporting small-scale farmers, who are the backbone of the global food system, and creating policies that promote local and regional food systems.

In conclusion, the challenge of food security is a complex one that requires a multifaceted solution. Rather than viewing technology and sustainability as mutually exclusive, we should seek to integrate them into a holistic approach that can nourish both people and the planet.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I’m going to talk about a time when I tried a new food for the first time. The food I tried was sushi, and it was a few years ago when I was on holiday in Japan with my family. I’d always been a bit hesitant to try sushi, as I wasn’t sure if I would like the idea of eating raw fish. However, my parents were keen to try it, so I decided to be adventurous and give it a go.

We went to a small, traditional sushi restaurant in Tokyo, and it was a really authentic experience. We sat at a counter, and the sushi chef prepared the food right in front of us. He was incredibly skillful and it was fascinating to watch him work. I started with something simple, a tuna roll, and I was pleasantly surprised. The fish was so fresh and the rice was perfectly seasoned. It was nothing like I had expected.

After that, I tried a few other types of sushi, including salmon and shrimp, and I enjoyed them all. I was with my parents and my brother, and we all had a great time sharing the different dishes and talking about what we liked. It was a really memorable meal, not just because the food was delicious, but also because it was a new and exciting cultural experience. I’m so glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried something new, and I’ve been a big fan of sushi ever since.

### SECTION 3

**(Sound of a university seminar room, with students chatting quietly in the background)**

**Tutor:** Okay, everyone, let's settle down. So, for today's seminar, we're going to be discussing the role of supermarkets in food security. Maria, would you like to start us off?

**Maria:** Sure, Dr. Evans. Well, I think that supermarkets are a huge part of the problem when it comes to food insecurity. They generate a massive amount of food waste, for one thing. And they also contribute to the homogenization of our diets, by promoting a narrow range of products and squeezing out smaller, local producers.

**David:** I'm not so sure I agree with that, Maria. I think supermarkets have actually done a lot to improve food security. They offer a wide variety of affordable food, and they're often the only source of fresh produce for people in low-income areas. And I think they're becoming more aware of the issue of food waste and are starting to take steps to address it.

**Tutor:** Interesting points from both of you. Dr. Evans, what are your thoughts?

**Dr. Evans:** Well, I think it's important to remember that supermarkets are just one part of a very complex and interconnected food system. They're not the sole cause of food insecurity, but they certainly have a role to play in both the problem and the solution. They have a huge amount of power and influence, and they could be doing a lot more to promote a more sustainable and equitable food system.

**Maria:** So what's the solution, then? How can we reduce the amount of food that supermarkets waste?

**Dr. Evans:** Well, there are a number of different approaches. Some people advocate for stricter government regulations, such as mandatory food waste reporting or a ban on sending food to landfill. Others focus on supporting food banks and other organizations that redistribute surplus food to those in need. And then there's the idea of trying to change consumer behavior, to encourage people to buy less and waste less.

**David:** I'm a bit skeptical about the consumer behavior approach. It's so difficult to change people's habits. And I think it's a bit unfair to put all the responsibility on consumers, when it's the supermarkets that are creating the problem in the first place.

**Tutor:** What do you think, Dr. Evans?

**Dr. Evans:** I agree that it's not just about individual responsibility. We need a systemic approach that involves all the different actors in the food system. But I do think that technology can play a role. For example, there are now apps that connect consumers with local stores and restaurants that have surplus food at the end of the day. And there's also a lot of interesting research being done into things like genetically modified crops that have a longer shelf life.

**Maria:** I'm a bit wary of technological solutions. I worry that they might have unintended negative consequences, or that they might not be accessible to everyone. I think we need to be careful not to just replace one set of problems with another.

**Tutor:** A very important point, Maria. So, to sum up, it seems we all agree that the problem of food waste is a complex one, and that there's no single, easy solution. It's going to require a combination of different approaches, from government regulation to technological innovation to changes in our own behavior.

### SECTION 4

**(Sound of a university lecture hall, with a lecturer speaking)**

**Lecturer:** Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the role of technology in addressing the challenge of food security. As we all know, the world is facing a monumental task: how to feed a growing population, which is expected to reach almost 10 billion by 2050, with limited resources. To do this, we need to create a more sustainable and resilient food system, and technology has a crucial role to play in that.

One of the most exciting areas of innovation is what's known as precision agriculture. This involves using data and technology to optimize farming practices. For example, farmers can use GPS-guided tractors to plant seeds with incredible accuracy, and they can use drones and sensors to monitor crop health and apply water and fertilizer exactly where they're needed. This not only increases yields and reduces waste, but it also has a lower environmental impact.

Another important development is controlled environment agriculture, or CEA. This basically means growing crops in controlled indoor environments, such as vertical farms. The big advantage of this is that you can grow crops year-round, regardless of the weather. You also use far less water and land than traditional agriculture, and you don't need to use pesticides. The main challenges, however, are the high energy costs and the limited crop diversity that can be grown in these systems.

Of course, we can't talk about agricultural technology without mentioning biotechnology. The use of genetic engineering to improve crops is a controversial topic, but it has the potential to make a huge contribution to food security. For example, scientists have developed drought-resistant maize, vitamin-enriched rice, and disease-resistant potatoes. However, there are legitimate concerns about the safety, ethics, and corporate control of this technology, and it's a debate that is likely to continue for many years to come.

Finally, I want to touch on the digital revolution in agriculture. The proliferation of mobile technology, big data, and artificial intelligence is transforming the way that farmers work, particularly in developing countries. These technologies can provide smallholder farmers with access to vital information, such as weather forecasts and market prices, as well as access to finance and other services. However, it's crucial that we ensure that this technology is inclusive and equitable, and that it doesn't leave the most vulnerable farmers behind.

In conclusion, technology is a powerful tool, but it's not a magic bullet. To achieve global food security, we need a holistic approach that combines technological innovation with social, economic, and political change. We need to empower farmers, protect the environment, and create a more just and equitable food system for all.
