**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Evolution of Human Rights**

The concept of human rights, as we understand it today, is the culmination of centuries of philosophical debate and political struggle. While the term “human rights” is relatively modern, the underlying principles of justice, fairness, and inherent human dignity can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Early legal codes, such as the Code of Hammurabi in Mesopotamia and the edicts of Emperor Ashoka in India, laid rudimentary foundations for the protection of individuals, albeit within the hierarchical structures of their time. These ancient precedents, however, did not embody the universalist vision that characterizes the modern human rights framework.

The philosophical bedrock of modern human rights was largely formed during the Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. Thinkers like John Locke articulated the theory of “natural rights,” proposing that individuals possess inherent rights to life, liberty, and property, which are not granted by any ruler but are intrinsic to human existence. This revolutionary idea challenged the prevailing doctrine of the divine right of kings and asserted that governments are established to protect these rights, not to bestow them. The concept of a social contract, where the governed consent to be ruled in exchange for the protection of their rights, became a cornerstone of liberal political philosophy.

The late 18th century witnessed the translation of these philosophical ideals into political reality through the American and French Revolutions. The United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 famously proclaimed that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,” echoing Locke’s philosophy. Similarly, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 asserted the universality of rights, stating that “men are born and remain free and equal in rights.” These declarations marked a pivotal moment, transforming abstract philosophical concepts into foundational principles of modern nation-states.

However, the universalism of these declarations was initially limited. The rights they proclaimed were often not extended to all members of society. Slavery persisted, women were largely excluded from the political sphere, and property qualifications restricted suffrage. The 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by social and political movements that fought to expand the scope of rights to include marginalized groups. The abolitionist movement, the women's suffrage movement, and the labor movement all played crucial roles in challenging the exclusionary practices of the time and advocating for a more inclusive understanding of human rights.

The cataclysmic events of the two World Wars in the 20th century served as a catalyst for the development of the modern international human rights framework. The world was horrified by the atrocities committed, and there was a growing consensus that a new international order was needed to prevent such horrors from happening again. This led to the establishment of the United Nations in 1945 and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. The UDHR was a landmark achievement, representing the first time in history that the international community came together to agree on a common standard of human rights for all peoples and nations.

While the UDHR is not a legally binding treaty, it has served as the foundation for a vast body of international human rights law, including numerous treaties and conventions that have been ratified by countries around the world. The evolution of human rights is an ongoing process, with new challenges and debates continually emerging. Nevertheless, the journey from ancient legal codes to the comprehensive international framework we have today demonstrates a long and arduous struggle for the recognition of the inherent dignity and equal rights of all members of the human family.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: A Monumental Achievement**

**A**
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, stands as a monumental achievement in the history of human civilization. For the first time, the international community came together to articulate a common standard of fundamental rights and freedoms for all people, everywhere. The Declaration was born from the ashes of the Second World War, a conflict that had witnessed unimaginable atrocities and a profound disregard for human life. The global consensus was that such horrors should never be repeated, and that a new framework was needed to protect the inherent dignity and worth of every human being.

**B**
The drafting of the UDHR was a truly global endeavor, involving representatives from diverse legal, cultural, and philosophical backgrounds. The drafting committee was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady of the United States, who played a pivotal role in steering the process. The committee included members from Australia, Chile, China, France, Lebanon, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, among others. This diversity ensured that the Declaration would not be a reflection of any single cultural or legal tradition, but rather a synthesis of values and principles shared by humanity as a whole.

**C**
The UDHR consists of a preamble and 30 articles that set out a broad range of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. The first two articles establish the fundamental principles of equality and non-discrimination. Subsequent articles cover a wide spectrum of rights, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person; freedom from slavery, torture, and arbitrary arrest; the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence; freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; and the right to education, work, and an adequate standard of living. The Declaration represents a holistic vision of human rights, recognizing that all rights are interconnected and indivisible.

**D**
While the UDHR is not a legally binding treaty in itself, its impact on international law and human rights has been profound. It has served as the primary source of inspiration for more than 70 human rights treaties and conventions, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These treaties, along with the UDHR, form the International Bill of Human Rights. The principles of the UDHR have also been incorporated into the constitutions and national laws of many countries, making it a truly global standard.

**E**
Despite its monumental status, the UDHR is not without its critics. Some have argued that its emphasis on individual rights reflects a Western bias and that it fails to adequately address the importance of collective rights and community values. Others have pointed to the gap between the lofty ideals of the Declaration and the reality of human rights abuses around the world. The challenge of implementation remains a significant obstacle, as the enforcement of human rights standards ultimately depends on the political will of individual states.

**F**
Nevertheless, the UDHR continues to be a powerful tool for promoting and protecting human rights. It provides a common language and a universal framework for human rights advocacy, and it serves as a source of inspiration and empowerment for individuals and groups fighting for justice and equality. The enduring relevance of the UDHR lies in its timeless message of hope and its unwavering commitment to the fundamental principle that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**Contemporary Challenges to Human Rights in the 21st Century**

The universal human rights framework, established in the mid-20th century, has been instrumental in advancing the cause of freedom and dignity worldwide. However, the 21st century has brought with it a host of new and complex challenges that threaten to undermine these hard-won gains. From the pervasive reach of digital technology to the escalating climate crisis, the landscape of human rights is being reshaped in profound and often unpredictable ways.

One of the most significant challenges is the rise of digital authoritarianism. Governments around the world are increasingly using technology to monitor, censor, and repress their citizens. Sophisticated surveillance systems, powered by artificial intelligence, are being deployed to track the movements and activities of individuals, while social media platforms are being used to spread disinformation and propaganda. The right to privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom of association are all under threat in this new digital age.

Another pressing issue is the impact of climate change on human rights. The effects of global warming, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and food and water shortages, are disproportionately affecting the world’s most vulnerable populations. The right to life, the right to health, and the right to an adequate standard of living are all being jeopardized by the climate crisis. Moreover, the transition to a green economy also presents human rights challenges, as the extraction of minerals for renewable energy technologies can lead to land grabs and the displacement of indigenous communities.

The global refugee crisis, fueled by conflict, persecution, and climate change, is another major challenge. Millions of people are being forced to flee their homes in search of safety and a better life, but they often face closed borders, xenophobia, and a lack of legal protection. The principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the return of refugees to a country where they would be in danger, is being eroded as countries prioritize national security concerns over their international obligations.

Furthermore, the persistence of economic inequality continues to be a major obstacle to the realization of human rights. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and many people are being left behind by the forces of globalization. The right to work, the right to education, and the right to social security are all being undermined by austerity measures, labor market deregulation, and the erosion of public services. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities, with low-income workers and marginalized communities bearing the brunt of the economic and social fallout.

In the face of these multifaceted challenges, the international human rights movement must adapt and innovate. New strategies are needed to hold governments and corporations accountable for their actions, to protect the rights of the most vulnerable, and to ensure that the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is realized for all. The struggle for human rights in the 21st century will require a concerted effort from civil society, international organizations, and individuals around the world.

**Man:** Thank you. I look forward to it.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for coming. My name is David, and I’m here today to talk to you about a fundamental human right that is often taken for granted: the right to education. For many of us, going to school is a normal part of our childhood. But for millions of children around the world, education is a distant dream. It is not a luxury, but a **fundamental human right** that is essential for personal development, social progress, and economic prosperity.

The main barrier to education for many children is **poverty**. Families living in poverty often cannot afford school fees, uniforms, or textbooks. They may also need their children to work to support the family. But poverty is not the only barrier. In many parts of the world, girls are particularly affected by cultural norms and expectations that prioritize boys’ education. They may be expected to marry young, or to stay at home to help with domestic chores. Lack of safe transportation to school and a shortage of female teachers can also be significant barriers for girls.

That’s why we launched the “Education for All” campaign. Our goal is to ensure that every child has access to **quality education**, regardless of their gender, background, or circumstances. We believe that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and creating a more just and equitable world.

So, what can you do to help? First, you can **raise awareness** about the importance of education. Talk to your friends and family, share our campaign on social media, and write to your elected representatives. Second, you can support our work on the ground. We have a number of initiatives that are making a real difference in the lives of children around the world.

For example, our “School Build” project focuses on **building and repairing schools** in remote and underserved communities. The “Girls Can” program is dedicated to **empowering girls through education**, providing them with scholarships, mentoring, and leadership training. Our “Textbooks for All” initiative aims to provide every child with the **school supplies** they need to learn. The “Safe Journey” project works to ensure that children have **safe transportation** to and from school. And our “Teacher Training” program focuses on **improving the quality of teaching** by providing teachers with the skills and resources they need to be effective.

Your support can help us to expand these programs and reach more children. Together, we can make the right to education a reality for all.

**SECTION 3**

**Tutor:** Hi Maria, hi David. Thanks for coming in today. So, you’re going to talk about the conflict between national security and individual freedoms. It’s a big topic.

**Maria:** Yes, we wanted to focus on the issue of surveillance. It’s something that’s become so prevalent in our society, and we think it raises some important questions about the balance between security and privacy.

**David:** Exactly. On the one hand, governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens from threats like terrorism. But on the other hand, we have a right to privacy and freedom of expression.

**Tutor:** So, what are some of the key issues?

**Maria:** Well, one of the main things is the increasing use of surveillance technology. With the **increasing threat of terrorism**, governments are using everything from CCTV cameras to online monitoring to keep track of people. And while this can be a valuable tool for law enforcement, it also has the potential to be misused.

**David:** I agree. I’m particularly concerned about the potential for mass surveillance to lead to a **loss of privacy and a chilling effect on free speech**. If people know they are being constantly monitored, they may be less likely to express dissenting opinions or to engage in political activism.

**Maria:** That’s a valid point. But I think surveillance can be justified if there is **proper oversight and accountability**. For example, if there are clear laws about what data can be collected and how it can be used, and if there is an independent body to oversee the use of surveillance technology.

**David:** The problem is that there is **little evidence to support its effectiveness**. A number of studies have shown that mass surveillance is not a particularly effective tool for preventing terrorism. And the current legal frameworks are often **outdated and in need of reform**.

**Maria:** I see your point. But I think a balance can be struck. We need **stronger legal frameworks and independent oversight** to ensure that surveillance is used in a targeted and proportionate way.

**David:** And we need to be aware of the “chilling effect” that I mentioned earlier. The **reluctance to express dissenting opinions for fear of being monitored** is a real threat to democracy.

**Tutor:** These are all excellent points. It’s clear that you’ve both thought about this issue in depth. And you’re right, there needs to be a **public conversation about the use of surveillance**. For your next assignment, I’d like you to **focus on a specific case study of surveillance**. It could be a particular technology, or a particular country. I think that would be a good way to explore these issues in more detail.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. Today, we’re going to be talking about international human rights law. This is a complex and fascinating area of law, and it’s one that has a profound impact on the lives of people all over the world.

So, what is international human rights law? In simple terms, it’s a set of rules and principles that are designed to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or any other status. It’s based on the fundamental principle of **inherent** dignity.

There are three main sources of international human rights law. The first is treaties, which are legally binding agreements between states. The most important of these is the International Bill of Human Rights, which consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The second source is customary international law, which is made up of unwritten rules that are considered binding on all states. And the third source is general principles of **law**, which are principles that are common to the legal systems of most countries.

There are a number of key principles that underpin international human rights law. The first is universality, which means that human rights belong to all people, everywhere. The second is indivisibility, which means that all rights are of equal **importance**. And the third is interdependence, which means that the enjoyment of one right is connected to the enjoyment of others.

Now, let’s turn to the enforcement of international human rights law. This is one of the biggest challenges in this area of law. There are a number of different enforcement mechanisms, including Charter-based bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, and treaty-based bodies, which are committees of experts that monitor the **implementation** of specific treaties. There are also regional human rights courts, such as the European Court of Human Rights.

However, there are a number of challenges to the enforcement of international human rights law. One of the biggest is state sovereignty. States are often reluctant to be bound by international law, and they may not be willing to cooperate with international enforcement mechanisms. Another challenge is the lack of a global **police** force. And finally, the enforcement of human rights depends on the political will of states to act.

Despite these challenges, non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, play a crucial role in the promotion and protection of human rights. They do this through monitoring and **reporting** human rights abuses, advocating for stronger legal protections, and providing assistance to **victims** of human rights violations.

Looking to the future, there are a number of new challenges to international human rights law. These include climate change, digital technology, and **terrorism**. There is a need for a more **holistic** approach to human rights, and for greater education and public **awareness**.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates global protection scores for four distinct human rights: Freedom of Expression, Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Movement, and Freedom from Torture. The scores are rated on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the highest level of protection.

Overall, the chart indicates varying levels of protection across the four rights. Freedom of Movement receives the highest score, while Freedom from Torture has the lowest, suggesting that the international community has been more successful in safeguarding some rights than others.

A closer look at the data reveals that Freedom of Movement is the best-protected right, with a score of 0.8. This is followed by Freedom of Religion, which has a respectable score of 0.7. Freedom of Expression is slightly less protected, with a score of 0.6.

In stark contrast, Freedom from Torture scores significantly lower than the other rights, at just 0.5. This figure is particularly concerning as it indicates a substantial gap in the protection of one of the most fundamental human rights. The difference of 0.3 between the highest and lowest scores highlights the uneven progress made in the global effort to protect human rights.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The perennial debate over the appropriate balance between national security and individual freedoms has become increasingly salient in the 21st century. While some contend that governments must be empowered to curtail certain rights to protect the state from existential threats, others maintain that fundamental human rights are sacrosanct and should never be compromised. This essay will explore both perspectives before arguing that while security is a legitimate concern, the erosion of fundamental rights is a far greater peril to a democratic society.

Proponents of prioritizing national security argue that the primary duty of any government is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. In an era of global terrorism, cyber warfare, and other transnational threats, it is argued that traditional law enforcement methods are no longer sufficient. Therefore, measures such as mass surveillance, increased powers of detention, and restrictions on freedom of speech may be necessary to prevent catastrophic events. The logic is that without security, the very concept of rights becomes meaningless, as a state in chaos cannot guarantee any freedoms. For instance, the implementation of airport security measures post-9/11, while intrusive, is often cited as a necessary trade-off to ensure public safety.

Conversely, a compelling case can be made for the inviolability of human rights. This perspective holds that rights are not granted by the state but are inherent to every individual. To allow governments to suspend these rights, even in the name of security, is to start down a slippery slope towards authoritarianism. History is replete with examples of regimes that have used the pretext of national security to silence dissent, persecute minorities, and consolidate power. The ‘chilling effect’ of surveillance on free expression, the potential for a miscarriage of justice when due process is suspended, and the danger of creating a society based on fear and suspicion are all potent arguments against sacrificing liberty for security. The protection of individual freedoms is the hallmark of a truly democratic and resilient society.

In my view, while the need for security is undeniable, it should not come at the cost of fundamental human rights. A society that sacrifices its core values in the name of security risks losing the very essence of what it is trying to protect. The challenge lies in finding a balance where security measures are targeted, proportionate, and subject to robust independent oversight. Rather than a zero-sum game, security and liberty should be seen as mutually reinforcing. A society where rights are respected is more likely to be stable and secure in the long run. Therefore, I firmly believe that the protection of human rights must remain the paramount concern, even in the face of significant security threats.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

I’d like to talk about a time when I stood up for someone’s rights at my previous workplace. It was about a year ago, and it involved a new colleague of mine, let’s call her Anna. Anna had just moved to our country and was still getting used to the language and the culture. She was a very talented and hardworking person, but she was also quite shy and reserved.

One day, during a team meeting, our manager was being unfairly critical of Anna’s work. He was using a very aggressive tone and was making some personal comments that were completely out of line. I could see that Anna was becoming very upset and was on the verge of tears. The rest of the team was just sitting there in silence, and I felt that I had to do something.

So, I decided to speak up. I calmly but firmly interrupted the manager and said that I didn’t think it was appropriate to speak to a colleague in that manner. I pointed out that Anna was a valuable member of the team and that she deserved to be treated with respect. I also suggested that if he had any issues with her work, he should discuss them with her privately.

I was quite nervous about speaking up, as the manager was known for his short temper. But I felt that it was the right thing to do. I believe that everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, especially in the workplace. Anna was new to the company and the country, and she was in a vulnerable position. I couldn’t just sit by and watch her be bullied. I’m glad I did it, because after the meeting, several other colleagues came up to me and said that they were glad I had said something. And more importantly, the manager’s behavior towards Anna improved significantly after that incident.
