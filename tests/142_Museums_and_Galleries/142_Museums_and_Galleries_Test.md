**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Evolving Role of Museums**

Traditionally, museums were seen as static repositories, quiet halls where artifacts and objects of historical and cultural significance were preserved and displayed. The average person viewed a museum as a place to observe the past, a silent institution dedicated to the conservation of collective memory. However, in the 21st century, this perception is being fundamentally challenged. Museums are undergoing a profound transformation, evolving from mere storehouses of history into dynamic, interactive spaces that engage with contemporary issues and foster community dialogue.

This evolution is significantly driven by technological advancements. Over the last two decades, modern tech has been the catalyst for reinventing the museum experience. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are no longer futuristic concepts but are actively being integrated into museum exhibits to create more immersive and educational experiences. For instance, the Detroit Institute of Arts employs an AR tour called Lumin, which allows visitors to use a handheld device to access additional information about artworks. Pointing the device at a sculpture or painting can reveal pop-up details, historical context, and even an ‘x-ray’ view of an ancient mummy, thereby deepening the visitor’s engagement with the collection. Similarly, the Cleveland Museum of Art’s ArtLens Interactive Studio features screen-based activities that require physical interaction, allowing visitors to virtually paint, create collages, and even try their hand at digital pottery.

Beyond the physical walls, technology has made museum collections more accessible than ever. For individuals who are unable to visit in person, museums are increasingly digitizing their collections and offering virtual tours, online galleries, and mobile apps. This digital outreach democratizes access to cultural heritage, allowing a global audience to explore priceless artifacts from their own homes. This shift not only broadens the museum’s reach but also redefines the very concept of a museum in the digital age.

In parallel with this technological revolution, there is a growing recognition of the museum’s role as an agent of social change. In an era marked by cultural polarization and social inequality, museums are stepping up to become active forums for public discourse and transformation. They are increasingly addressing critical social issues such as identity, inequality, and colonial legacies. For example, many institutions are re-examining their collections to acknowledge and confront their colonial pasts. The global repatriation of the Benin Bronzes, looted by British forces in 1897, is a powerful example of this ethical shift. The unconditional return of these artifacts by governments and museums signifies a move towards accountability, healing, and the restoration of cultural ownership.

Furthermore, museums are striving to be more inclusive and representative of the diverse communities they serve. This includes creating exhibitions that reflect a multitude of perspectives and histories, as well as implementing policies to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Yaba Art Museum in Nigeria, for instance, launched an initiative to sponsor underprivileged students through an art adoption program, demonstrating how museums can bridge institutional knowledge with civic consciousness. Such participatory initiatives prove that art is not just for observation but can be a catalyst for life, learning, and social transformation.

The educational mandate of museums also continues to be a core function, albeit with a modern approach. Museums are no longer just for quiet contemplation; they are vibrant educational hubs. Many institutions offer extensive programming for children and adults, from hands-on workshops to lectures and guided tours. The Tate in London, for example, has a dedicated website for children, Tate Kids, which offers games, quizzes, and videos to make art accessible and engaging for a younger audience. These initiatives underscore the enduring importance of museums as educational institutions that inspire curiosity and lifelong learning.

In conclusion, the museum of the 21st century is a multifaceted institution. It is at once a guardian of history, a pioneer of technology, a forum for social dialogue, and a center for education. As they continue to navigate the complexities of the modern world, museums are proving that they are not just relevant but essential, offering spaces for connection, reflection, and inspiration in an ever-changing global landscape.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Bilbao Effect: Architecture as a Catalyst for Urban Rebirth**

**A**
In the annals of modern architecture, few buildings have had as profound an impact as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Opened in 1997, this architectural marvel, designed by Frank Gehry, is credited with single-handedly revitalizing a city in decline. The phenomenon, now famously known as the “Bilbao effect,” describes the transformative power of a single, high-profile cultural project to stimulate economic growth, attract tourism, and redefine a city’s image on the global stage. Before the museum’s arrival, Bilbao was a post-industrial city grappling with economic hardship and the shadow of Basque separatist terrorism. The decision to invest in a world-class museum was a bold, and ultimately, a brilliantly successful gamble.

**B**
The concept was not entirely without precedent. Cities like Sydney, with its iconic Opera House, and Paris, with the Pompidou Centre, had already demonstrated the potential of landmark architecture to become a symbol of a city’s identity and a magnet for visitors. However, what set Bilbao apart was the sheer audacity of the project in the context of the city’s then-depressed state. The Basque regional government, in a strategic partnership with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, committed to financing the construction and operation of the museum. In return, the Guggenheim lent its prestigious name, its collection, and its curatorial expertise. This collaboration, though criticized by some as a form of “cultural imperialism,” provided Bilbao with instant access to the upper echelons of the art world.

**C**
At the heart of the Bilbao effect is, of course, the building itself. Frank Gehry, a Canadian-born architect then in his 60s, was chosen for the project. Already respected in architectural circles for his deconstructed, sculptural style, Gehry was about to become a global celebrity. His design for the Guggenheim Bilbao is a spectacular composition of swirling titanium, glass, and limestone, evoking the city’s industrial past with its ship-like forms, while simultaneously appearing as a futuristic, almost living, organism. The building’s complex, curvilinear shapes were made possible by the pioneering use of CATIA, a software originally developed for the aerospace industry. This technology allowed Gehry to realize his ambitious vision within a surprisingly reasonable budget, proving that radical design did not have to be prohibitively expensive.

**D**
The success of the Guggenheim Bilbao was immediate and overwhelming. The museum attracted over a million visitors in its first year and has maintained that figure ever since. This influx of tourists brought with it a wave of economic benefits, from hotel and restaurant revenues to the creation of new jobs. The museum became a powerful symbol of Bilbao’s renewal, fostering a renewed sense of civic pride and optimism. The “Bilbao effect” became a buzzword in urban planning circles, and cities around the world scrambled to replicate its success, commissioning their own “iconic” buildings in the hope of achieving a similar urban renaissance.

**E**
However, the legacy of the Bilbao effect is not without its critics. One of the most persistent criticisms leveled against the Guggenheim Bilbao is that the building’s spectacular architecture overshadows the art it is meant to house. The critic Hal Foster argued that the museum provides “a sublime space that overwhelms the viewer,” turning the building itself into the main attraction. Gehry himself has countered this, stating that artists appreciate the opportunity to exhibit in a significant architectural space. He has also distanced himself from the cruder imitations of his work, lamenting the proliferation of “odd-shaped buildings” that lack the thoughtful connection to their context that he strove for in Bilbao.

**F**
Indeed, the many attempts to replicate the Bilbao effect have had mixed results. For every success story, there are cautionary tales of expensive, flamboyant buildings that failed to deliver the promised economic and social benefits. The key to Bilbao’s success, it seems, was not just a showy building, but a confluence of factors: a strategic vision, a strong public-private partnership, a world-class cultural institution, and an architect who, for all his formal experimentation, was deeply engaged with the city’s history and identity. The Bilbao effect, therefore, is not a simple formula to be copied, but a complex and context-specific phenomenon. It serves as a powerful reminder that while architecture can be a potent catalyst for change, it is never a solution in itself.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Louvre: From Fortress to Global Icon**

The Louvre, in Paris, France, is arguably the most famous museum in the world. Its vast collection, which spans from antiquity to the 19th century, includes some of the most celebrated works of art in human history, most notably the Mona Lisa. However, the Louvre is more than just a repository of priceless artifacts; it is a historical monument in its own right, a sprawling palace that has evolved over eight centuries, reflecting the tumultuous history of France itself.

The story of the Louvre begins in the late 12th century, when King Philip II commissioned a fortress on the banks of the Seine to protect Paris from Viking raids. This original structure, the medieval Louvre, was a formidable stone keep, the remnants of which are still visible in the museum’s basement. Over the centuries, the fortress was gradually transformed into a royal residence. In the 14th century, Charles V was the first French king to make the Louvre his home, and subsequent monarchs, including Francis I, expanded and embellished the palace in the prevailing architectural styles of their time, from Gothic to Renaissance.

It was not until the French Revolution that the Louvre’s destiny as a public museum was sealed. In 1793, the revolutionary government opened the Musée Central des Arts in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, putting the former royal collection on public display for the first time. This was a radical act, a symbolic transfer of cultural ownership from the monarchy to the people. Napoleon Bonaparte further enriched the museum’s collection with spoils of war from his military campaigns across Europe, temporarily renaming it the Musée Napoléon.

The 20th century brought the most dramatic and controversial transformation to the Louvre. By the 1980s, the museum was struggling to cope with a dramatic increase in visitors. The old entrance was cramped and confusing, leading to long queues and a frustrating visitor experience. In 1983, President François Mitterrand launched the “Grand Louvre” project, an ambitious plan to modernize and expand the museum. He commissioned the Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei to design a new entrance in the central courtyard, the Cour Napoléon.

Pei’s solution was both audacious and elegant: a large glass and steel pyramid, flanked by three smaller ones, which would serve as the new main entrance and provide light to the vast underground lobby beneath. The design was met with a firestorm of criticism. Many Parisians felt that the modernist pyramid was a sacrilegious intrusion into the historical fabric of the Louvre, a jarring juxtaposition of the old and the new. The press derided it as an “architectural joke” and a “gigantic, ruinous gadget.”

Despite the initial outrage, the Louvre Pyramid was completed in 1989 and quickly won over its critics. The pyramid’s transparent structure allowed it to be both a strong, geometric statement and a light, almost ethereal presence that did not overwhelm the surrounding historical facades. It proved to be a highly functional solution to the museum’s logistical problems, creating a clear, welcoming entrance and improving visitor flow. More than that, it became a new symbol for the Louvre, a modern icon that, like the Eiffel Tower before it, blended seamlessly into the Parisian landscape.

Today, the Louvre Pyramid is as much a part of the museum’s identity as the Mona Lisa. It is a testament to the Louvre’s ability to reinvent itself, to embrace the future without erasing the past. The museum continues to evolve, with new wings, renovated galleries, and a growing digital presence. From a medieval fortress to a royal palace to a public museum, the Louvre has always been a mirror to the changing world, a place where history is not just preserved, but is continually being made.

**Listening Script: Section 2**

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the City Museum. My name is David, and I’ll be your guide for this tour of the ‘Art of the People’ gallery. This gallery is unique because it doesn’t feature the grand portraits of kings and queens or epic battle scenes you might find elsewhere in the museum. Instead, it celebrates the art and craftsmanship of ordinary people, telling the story of their daily lives, work, and traditions through the objects they made and used.

The collection spans several centuries, with the earliest pieces dating from the **16th century** right up to the present day. As we walk through, you’ll see how everyday items can be both functional and beautiful, and how they give us a fascinating insight into the social history of our city.

We’ll begin our tour here, in the main hall. If you look to your left, you’ll see one of the gallery’s most treasured pieces, a large oil painting called ‘The Market Stall’. This work, from the 17th century, is a wonderful example of the realism of the period. It’s not a romanticized image; instead, it shows a bustling market scene with incredible attention to detail – you can almost smell the fruit and hear the chatter of the crowd. It’s a celebration of the vibrancy of everyday commerce.

Now, as we move into the first room of the gallery, you’ll see a collection of domestic objects. I’d like you to pay particular attention to the **craftsmanship** of these items. These are not mass-produced goods; they were made by hand, and you can see the skill and care that went into each piece, from the carved wooden spoons to the hand-painted pottery. They remind us of a time when the objects in our homes were made to last.

At the end of this room, you’ll find a very special exhibit: the ‘Community Quilt’. This is a modern piece, created just last year. What makes it so special is that it was a collaborative project. Over one hundred people from our local community, from young children to senior citizens, each contributed a square, telling their own story of life in the city. It’s a vibrant patchwork of personal histories and a testament to the power of art to bring people together.

Now, let’s look at the plan of the gallery so you can explore on your own. We are currently in the entrance hall, just by the main doors. The large central area has some comfortable seating if you need a rest at any point.

Let’s start with the painting I mentioned earlier, ‘The Harvest’. It’s a large, beautiful landscape. To see it, you go through the door on the left of the hall and it’s in the first room you come to, on the far wall. That’s room **D**.

Next, the 18th-Century Pottery collection. From the entrance hall, you’ll want to go straight ahead, past the seating area, into the room directly opposite the entrance. The pottery is displayed in cabinets in the centre of that room, which is room **B**.

Now for the Children’s Toys exhibit. This is a lovely collection of handmade toys from the 19th century. From the entrance, go left into room D, then turn right into the adjoining room, which is room **E**. The toys are in a glass case on your right.

Another highlight is ‘The Shoemaker’, a life-sized bronze sculpture. To find this, you go from the entrance hall, straight ahead, through room B, and into the room at the very back of the gallery. The sculpture is in the corner. That’s room **A**.

Finally, the Community Quilt. It’s a very large and colourful piece, so it’s easy to spot. From the entrance hall, you go through the door on your right, and it’s hanging on the main wall of that room, room **G**.

So, please take your time to explore. I’ll be here if you have any questions.

**Chloe:** So, Tom, we need to finalize the topic for our presentation on museum studies. I’ve been doing some reading, and I’m getting really interested in the impact of **digital technology**.

**Tom:** That’s funny, me too. I think it’s the most significant change to happen to museums in the last hundred years. I was reading an article about how museums are using everything from mobile apps to virtual reality. It’s fascinating.

**Chloe:** I know! I always thought of museums as being quite traditional, but some of the things they’re doing are incredibly innovative. I was a bit taken aback, to be honest. I expected them to be much further behind the curve.

**Tom:** Me too. I’m particularly interested in virtual reality. Think about it – you could not just see an object from ancient Rome, but you could actually ‘walk around’ a reconstruction of a Roman villa. It would make history so much more tangible.

**Chloe:** Absolutely. But I do have some reservations. My main concern is that all these digital bells and whistles might end up being a **distraction**. You know, people might get so caught up in the interactive game that they don’t actually look at the real artifacts on display.

**Tom:** That’s a valid point. It’s a question of balance, isn’t it? The technology should enhance the experience, not dominate it. But think about the potential for outreach. I was reading about how museums are using social media. It’s not just about advertising their exhibitions anymore.

**Chloe:** You mean things like posting pictures of their collections on Instagram?

**Tom:** Exactly. It’s about engaging with people who might never have thought of visiting a museum before. It helps to break down that image of museums as being stuffy and elitist. It can bring in a much **younger and more diverse audience**.

**Chloe:** That’s true. And it can make the museum feel more human. I saw a great example of that with the ‘Ask a Curator’ day on Twitter. People could ask questions directly to the experts. It was a brilliant way of **making the curators and their knowledge more accessible**.

**Tom:** I saw that! It was fantastic. And there’s also the whole area of data. Museums can now collect information about what exhibits people are visiting, how long they spend in certain areas... all that kind of thing.

**Chloe:** It sounds a bit like surveillance!

**Tom:** It can be, if it’s not handled properly. But if it’s used ethically, it can be incredibly useful. It can help museums understand their visitors better and **improve the overall experience**. For example, if they see that nobody is visiting a particular room, they can rethink the layout or the interpretation.

**Chloe:** I see what you mean. So, the technology isn’t just for the visitors; it’s for the museum staff as well. I suppose the key is that the technology should always be in service of the museum’s mission. It’s not about having technology for technology’s sake.

**Tom:** Precisely. It has to **support the core functions** of preservation, research, and education.

**Chloe:** I think we’re on the same page, then. But we should also consider the downsides. We’ve mentioned the risk of distraction. What else?

**Tom:** Well, one thing that worries me is that it can make the museum visit a more solitary experience. If everyone is walking around staring at their own phone or wearing a VR headset, they’re not interacting with the people they came with. It could become quite an **individual, isolated activity**.

**Chloe:** That’s a really good point. The social aspect of a museum visit is so important. We should definitely include that in our presentation. So, what’s our next step? We need to move from these general ideas to a concrete plan.

**Tom:** I think we need to look for some **specific case studies**. We could find a couple of museums that are using technology in interesting ways – one that’s doing it well, and maybe one that’s a cautionary tale. That would give our presentation some real substance.

**Chloe:** Great idea. I’ll start looking for some examples online. We can compare notes next week.

**Listening Script: Section 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to discuss the changing role of the museum curator. The word ‘curator’ comes from the Latin ‘curare’, meaning ‘to take care of’. And for a long time, that was a fitting description. The curator was, first and foremost, a **keeper** of the collection. Their world was the world of the storeroom and the research library, and their primary responsibilities were the acquisition, preservation, and scholarly study of objects.

However, in the last few decades, this traditional, inward-looking role has been transformed. The modern curator is a much more public and collaborative figure. And perhaps the most important skill they need today is **storytelling**. A curator no longer simply puts objects in a case; they use those objects to construct a narrative, to tell a story that will engage and enlighten the visitor.

So, how does a curator go about creating an exhibition? Well, the initial spark can come from many places, but it often begins with a single, powerful **idea**. This could be an anniversary, a new discovery, or a desire to look at a familiar topic in a new light. From that starting point, the curator begins to select objects that will help to tell the story. This is a complex process. It’s not just about picking the most beautiful or valuable items. The curator has to think about how the objects will ‘speak’ to each other, and how they will guide the visitor on a journey.

This process is rarely a solitary one. It involves a great deal of negotiation with other departments in the museum – with the conservators, who have to ensure the objects are safe to display; with the designers, who create the physical environment of the exhibition; and with the education team, who develop the public programs. There can be a lot of **compromise** involved in balancing the curatorial vision with these practical constraints.

One of the central challenges for any curator is the issue of context. An object in a museum is, by definition, removed from its original function and environment. A Roman pot, for example, is no longer used for storing wine; it is an artifact behind glass. The curator’s job is to bridge that gap, to provide the context that allows the visitor to understand the object’s significance. This is done through a variety of means – wall texts, labels, photographs, and, increasingly, digital media. The exhibition text is particularly important. It needs to be informative, but it also needs to be concise and, crucially, **accessible** to a non-specialist audience.

Of course, providing context inevitably involves interpretation. And this is where the curator’s role becomes particularly complex. There is no single, objective truth about an object’s meaning. The curator must make choices, and those choices are inevitably shaped by their own background, their own perspective, their own **bias**. A good curator is aware of this and will often try to present multiple viewpoints, to acknowledge the different ways an object can be understood. They might pose **questions** rather than providing definitive answers, encouraging the visitor to think for themselves.

This leads us to the ethical dimension of curation. Curators have a profound responsibility, not just to the objects themselves, but to the communities from which those objects came. This is especially true when dealing with culturally sensitive materials or objects that have a **controversial** history, such as those acquired during the colonial era. In recent years, there has been a move towards co-curation, where museums work directly with community members to interpret their own cultural heritage. This is a vital step in making museums more equitable and inclusive spaces.

So, what does the future hold for curation? The role will undoubtedly continue to evolve. Digital tools will offer new ways to create more personalized and **interactive** experiences for visitors. Imagine a future where an exhibition can adapt itself to your specific interests in real time. However, I believe that the fundamental skills of the curator will remain unchanged. The ability to look deeply at an object, to understand its history and significance, and to connect it to other objects and ideas in a **meaningful** way – that will always be the true art of curation.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the number of visitors, in millions, to four London museums—the British Museum, Tate Modern, the Natural History Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum—for the years 2018, 2020, and 2022.

Overall, the British Museum was the most visited museum in 2018 and 2022, while all four institutions experienced a dramatic fall in visitor numbers in 2020, followed by a significant recovery in 2022. Despite this recovery, none of the museums had reached their 2018 visitor levels by 2022.

In 2018, the British Museum and Tate Modern were the most popular, with 6.2 and 5.9 million visitors respectively. The Natural History Museum received 4.9 million visitors, while the Victoria and Albert Museum had the lowest number at 3.9 million. 

In 2020, there was a sharp decline in attendance for all museums. The British Museum and Tate Modern saw their visitor numbers plummet to 1.3 and 1.4 million respectively. The Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum experienced similar drops, to 1.1 and 0.8 million visitors.

By 2022, all four museums showed a strong rebound. The British Museum’s visitor numbers rose to 4.1 million, and the Natural History Museum saw a remarkable recovery to 4.7 million, making it the second most visited in that year. Tate Modern and the Victoria and Albert Museum also saw their numbers increase, to 3.9 and 2.4 million respectively.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

The assertion that museums and art galleries have become obsolete in an era of digital proliferation is a contentious one. While it is true that online archives and virtual tours offer unprecedented access to cultural heritage, I firmly disagree with the notion that they render physical institutions unnecessary. The experience of engaging with art and artifacts in person is fundamentally different and, I believe, irreplaceable.

Firstly, the argument for the redundancy of museums often overlooks the unique power of physical presence. Viewing a high-resolution image of a Van Gogh painting online, for instance, cannot replicate the experience of standing before the original canvas, observing the texture of the brushstrokes, and sensing the scale and presence of the work. The aura of an authentic object, its history, and its journey through time, is a palpable force that digital reproductions cannot convey. This direct, unmediated encounter with an artifact can foster a much deeper connection and understanding than a screen-based interaction.

Secondly, museums are not merely repositories of objects; they are vital social and educational spaces. They serve as community hubs where people of all ages and backgrounds can learn, reflect, and engage in dialogue. School trips to museums are a cornerstone of education, providing children with tangible links to the past and inspiring a lifelong love of learning. Furthermore, the curated journey through an exhibition is a form of storytelling, a narrative crafted by experts that guides the visitor and provides context that is often lost in the fragmented nature of online browsing. The shared experience of visiting a gallery with friends or family creates lasting memories and stimulates conversation in a way that solitary online viewing cannot.

Of course, the benefits of digital access are undeniable. Online collections democratize art, making it available to a global audience, including those who may be unable to visit museums due to geographical, financial, or physical constraints. Virtual reality can offer immersive reconstructions of historical sites, and digital archives are an invaluable resource for researchers. However, these digital tools should be seen as a complement to, not a substitute for, the physical museum. They can whet the appetite, provide supplementary information, and extend the museum’s reach, but they cannot replace the core experience.

In conclusion, while the digital world has transformed how we access information and culture, it has not made museums and galleries redundant. The profound, multi-sensory experience of engaging with authentic objects in a shared, physical space remains as crucial as ever for education, community engagement, and the fostering of a deep and personal connection with our collective heritage.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

(The candidate has 1 minute to prepare)

Alright, so the museum I’d like to talk about is the Natural History Museum in London. It’s a really famous landmark, located in South Kensington, right next to the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. It’s a huge, beautiful building that looks more like a cathedral than a museum.

I visited it a couple of years ago with my family. We were on a short holiday in London, and it was high on our list of places to see. I’ve always been interested in the natural world, so for me, it was a must-see. The main reason for the visit was really just curiosity and the desire to see some of its iconic exhibits in person.

The museum contains a vast collection of specimens from all areas of natural history. The most famous exhibit, and the first thing you see when you walk into the main hall, is the enormous blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling. It’s absolutely breathtaking and really gives you a sense of the scale of life on our planet. There are also extensive dinosaur skeletons, a fascinating section on human evolution, and countless displays of animals, plants, and minerals from all over the world.

What I particularly liked about it was the sheer scale and grandeur of the place. The building itself is as much of an exhibit as the things inside it. The architecture is just stunning. I also loved how they managed to make the science so accessible and engaging for all ages. The interactive displays and the way they presented the information were really well done. If I had to say something I disliked, it would probably be how crowded it was. It’s an incredibly popular museum, so there were a lot of people, which sometimes made it a bit difficult to see everything properly. But that’s a minor point, really. Overall, it was an amazing and very memorable experience.
