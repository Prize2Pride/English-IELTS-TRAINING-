**The Digital Maze: Understanding Internet Addiction**

The internet has become an indispensable tool in modern society, revolutionizing communication, education, and entertainment. Its vast resources and unparalleled connectivity have brought immense benefits, but a darker side has emerged in the form of internet addiction. This behavioral addiction, also known as problematic internet use or compulsive internet use, is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to use the internet, to the point where it negatively impacts a person's well-being, relationships, and daily functioning. While not yet officially recognized as a distinct disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the scientific community widely acknowledges its existence and debilitating effects.

Internet addiction manifests in various ways, often depending on the type of online activities an individual engages in. Some common forms include cyber-relationship addiction, where individuals become overly invested in online relationships, often neglecting real-life connections. Another prevalent form is information-seeking addiction, characterized by an obsessive need to gather and hoard information online. Gaming addiction, particularly with massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), is also a significant concern, as is an addiction to online shopping, gambling, or pornography. Regardless of the specific form, the underlying mechanism is similar: the individual experiences a sense of euphoria or relief while online, which reinforces the behavior and leads to a cycle of dependency.

The psychological underpinnings of internet addiction are complex and multifaceted. Research suggests that individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are more susceptible to developing this addiction. The internet can serve as an escape from real-world problems, providing a temporary sense of control and satisfaction that is otherwise lacking in their lives. The anonymity and social acceptance found in online communities can be particularly appealing to those who struggle with social anxiety or low self-esteem. Furthermore, the design of many websites and applications, with their constant notifications and reward systems, can contribute to the development of addictive behaviors.

The consequences of internet addiction can be severe and far-reaching. Academically and professionally, individuals may experience a decline in performance due to the excessive time spent online. Relationships with family and friends can suffer as real-life interactions are replaced by virtual ones. Physical health problems, such as eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and sleep disturbances, are also common. Moreover, the constant exposure to curated online personas and idealized lifestyles can lead to feelings of inadequacy, envy, and depression. In extreme cases, internet addiction can result in financial problems, legal issues, and even suicide.

Addressing internet addiction requires a multi-pronged approach. The first step is to recognize the problem and seek professional help. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown promise in treating this addiction by helping individuals identify and change their negative thought patterns and behaviors. Support groups and family therapy can also be beneficial in providing a network of understanding and encouragement. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to treat underlying mental health conditions. Ultimately, the goal is to help individuals regain control over their internet use and develop a healthier, more balanced relationship with technology.

_Reading Passage 2_

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Science of Screen Time: How Digital Devices Affect the Brain**

**A**
The proliferation of digital devices has fundamentally altered the way we interact with the world. From smartphones to tablets, these glowing rectangles have become ubiquitous, offering instant access to information and entertainment. However, growing concerns about the impact of excessive screen time on the brain have prompted a wave of scientific research. Neuroscientists are now beginning to unravel the complex ways in which our brains are being reshaped by the digital age, and the findings are both fascinating and alarming.

**B**
One of the most significant effects of screen time is on the brain's reward system. The constant stream of notifications, likes, and other forms of positive reinforcement from social media and games triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. This creates a feedback loop that encourages us to spend more and more time on our devices, seeking out the next digital 'hit.' Over time, this can lead to a desensitization of the reward system, making it harder to experience pleasure from other, more natural sources.

**C**
Another area of concern is the impact of screen time on attention and focus. The fast-paced, hyper-stimulating nature of digital media can make it difficult for our brains to sustain attention on a single task for an extended period. This can lead to a state of 'continuous partial attention,' where we are constantly switching between different tasks and never fully engaged in any of them. This can have a detrimental effect on our ability to learn, remember, and think critically.

**D**
The blue light emitted from screens can also have a significant impact on our sleep patterns. This light suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. As a result, using digital devices before bed can make it harder to fall asleep and can reduce the quality of our sleep. This can lead to a host of health problems, including fatigue, irritability, and an increased risk of chronic diseases.

**E**
Furthermore, excessive screen time has been linked to changes in the brain's structure. Studies have shown that individuals with internet addiction have reduced gray matter in certain areas of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as planning, decision-making, and impulse control. These changes are similar to those seen in individuals with substance addictions, suggesting that problematic internet use may be a true addiction.

**F**
Despite these concerns, it is important to remember that not all screen time is created equal. The impact of digital devices on the brain depends on a variety of factors, including the type of content being consumed, the context in which it is being used, and the individual's age and personality. For example, using a tablet to read an e-book is likely to have a different effect on the brain than spending hours playing a violent video game. Similarly, using a computer for work or school is different from mindlessly scrolling through social media.

_Reading Passage 3_

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**Digital Detox: A Path to Reclaiming Our Lives**

The constant connectivity of the digital world has left many feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and disconnected from their real lives. In response, a growing movement known as 'digital detox' has emerged, encouraging individuals to take a break from their devices and reconnect with the world around them. A digital detox can range from a few hours of screen-free time each day to a complete disconnection from all digital devices for an extended period. The goal is to reduce stress, improve well-being, and cultivate a more mindful and intentional relationship with technology.

The concept of a digital detox is not simply about abstaining from technology; it is about creating space for other activities that are essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. This can include spending time in nature, engaging in hobbies, connecting with loved ones face-to-face, and practicing mindfulness and meditation. By disconnecting from the digital world, we can reconnect with ourselves and the things that truly matter to us. This can lead to a renewed sense of purpose, creativity, and joy.

There are many potential benefits to a digital detox. Research has shown that taking a break from screens can lead to improved sleep, reduced eye strain, and a decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression. It can also improve our ability to focus and concentrate, as well as our creativity and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, a digital detox can help us to cultivate a greater sense of presence and mindfulness in our daily lives, allowing us to fully experience and appreciate the world around us.

However, a digital detox is not without its challenges. In a world where so much of our personal and professional lives are conducted online, it can be difficult to completely disconnect. Many people experience a fear of missing out (FOMO) when they are not constantly connected, and the pressure to be available 24/7 can be immense. It is important to approach a digital detox in a way that is realistic and sustainable for your individual circumstances. This may involve starting with small, manageable changes, such as turning off notifications or scheduling regular screen-free time into your day.

For those who are struggling with a more serious internet addiction, a digital detox may not be enough. In these cases, it is important to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction. They can provide the support and guidance needed to address the underlying issues and develop a long-term plan for recovery. A digital detox can be a valuable tool in this process, but it should not be seen as a cure-all.

Ultimately, the goal of a digital detox is not to demonize technology, but to cultivate a more balanced and intentional relationship with it. By taking regular breaks from our devices, we can reclaim our time, attention, and energy, and reinvest them in the things that truly matter to us. In a world that is increasingly dominated by screens, a digital detox may be one of the most important things we can do for our well-being.

First, I want to talk about the concept of a ‘digital sunset’. This is a time each evening when you turn off all your digital devices, at least an hour before you go to bed. This can help to improve your sleep quality and reduce the temptation to scroll through social media late at night. So, my first piece of advice is to establish a **(11) digital sunset** in your home.

Next, let's talk about social media. It can be a great tool for connecting with others, but it can also be a huge time sink. My recommendation is to **(12) schedule a specific time** to check your social media accounts each day, rather than constantly checking them throughout the day. This will help you to be more intentional with your use of social media and prevent it from taking over your life.

Another tip is to create a ‘digital-free’ bedroom. This means no phones, no tablets, no TVs in the bedroom. This can be a difficult change to make, but it can have a huge impact on your sleep quality. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, I recommend buying a **(13) physical alarm clock** instead. This will remove the temptation to check your phone first thing in the morning.

Finally, I want to remind you to be patient with yourself. Changing your habits takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Don't get discouraged if you have a day where you spend more time on your phone than you intended. Just acknowledge it and get back on track the next day. The goal is progress, not perfection. So, my final piece of advice is to **(14) be patient with yourself**.

Now, let's move on to some specific recommendations for different activities. When it comes to **(16) waking up**, as I mentioned, I recommend using a **(B) physical alarm clock**. For your **(17) commute**, instead of scrolling through your phone, why not try **(C) listening to a podcast**? When you're **(18) working**, it's important to minimize distractions, so I suggest **(A) turning off notifications**. When you're **(19) winding down** in the evening, instead of watching TV, try **(F) reading a physical book**. And for **(20) social media**, as well as scheduling a specific time to check it, I also recommend **(E) unfollowing negative accounts** that make you feel bad about yourself.

**SECTION 3**

**Interviewer:** Welcome to the show, Dr. Evans. Today we're talking about the impact of social media on mental health. Dr. Evans, is internet addiction a real thing?
**Dr. Evans:** That's a great question. The term ‘internet addiction’ is still quite **(22) controversial** and is not yet officially recognized as a distinct disorder in the main diagnostic manuals. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that for some people, problematic internet use can be a very real and debilitating problem.
**Interviewer:** What are some of the challenges in diagnosing internet addiction?
**Dr. Evans:** One of the main challenges is that it's difficult to **(23) distinguish from normal internet use**. We all use the internet a lot in our daily lives, so it can be hard to know where to draw the line between normal use and addictive behavior. There are also no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult for clinicians to make a diagnosis.
**Interviewer:** Chloe, you've written a book about your own experience with internet addiction. Can you tell us a bit about that?
**Chloe:** Sure. For me, it started in my late teens. I was spending more and more time online, to the point where it was affecting my studies and my relationships. I was constantly checking my phone, and I felt anxious and irritable when I couldn't be online. I definitely **(24) struggled with spending too much time online**.
**Interviewer:** Dr. Evans, can you explain the science behind what's happening in the brain when someone becomes addicted to the internet?
**Dr. Evans:** Of course. It has to do with the brain's **(25) reward pathway**. This is the part of the brain that is activated by pleasurable experiences, such as eating good food or spending time with loved ones. When we do something that we enjoy, the brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which makes us feel good and encourages us to repeat the behavior.
**Interviewer:** And how does the internet affect this reward pathway?
**Dr. Evans:** The internet, and particularly social media, can **(26) overstimulate the reward pathway**. The constant stream of likes, comments, and notifications provides a steady stream of positive reinforcement, which can lead to a cycle of addictive behavior. It's a bit like a slot machine. You never know when you're going to get a reward, so you keep pulling the lever. This is known as **(27) variable ratio reinforcement**, and it's a very powerful psychological principle.
**Interviewer:** So, a slot machine is a good example of this?
**Dr. Evans:** Yes, a **(28) slot machine** is a classic example. You don't get a reward every time you play, but the unpredictability of the rewards is what keeps you hooked.
**Interviewer:** What is the main conclusion we can draw from this discussion?
**Dr. Evans:** I think the main conclusion is that internet addiction is a **(29) serious problem that requires more research**. We need to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this addiction so that we can develop more effective treatments.
**Interviewer:** And what would you recommend for people who are concerned about their internet use?
**Dr. Evans:** I would recommend that they **(30) monitor their time online and set limits**. There are a number of apps that can help with this. If they are still concerned, they should seek professional help.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be talking about the psychology of internet addiction. As we've already discussed, internet addiction is a complex issue with a variety of contributing factors. Today, we're going to focus on the psychological mechanisms that underlie this addiction.

First, let's consider the role of personality. Research has shown that certain personality traits can make individuals more susceptible to internet addiction. For example, individuals who are high in **(31) neuroticism** are more likely to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression, and they may use the internet as a way to cope with these feelings. They are also more likely to seek validation and approval through social media. In contrast, individuals who are high in **(32) impulsivity** may be more prone to impulsive and risky online behaviors, such as online gambling or compulsive shopping.

Next, let's turn to the role of cognition. Cognitive distortions, or irrational ways of thinking, can also play a role in internet addiction. For example, individuals may have an inflated sense of their **(33) online self** and abilities. They may believe that they are more popular, confident, or successful online than they are in real life. They may also have a tendency to **(34) catastrophize** the positive aspects of being online and downplay the negative consequences.

Emotion regulation is another key factor in internet addiction. Individuals may use the internet as a way to cope with **(35) negative** emotions, such as boredom, loneliness, or stress. This can create a cycle of dependency, where the individual comes to rely on the internet as their primary means of **(36) emotional support**.

Finally, let's consider the role of social factors. Social isolation can be both a cause and a consequence of internet addiction. Individuals who feel disconnected from their **(37) offline community** may turn to the internet for a sense of belonging. However, excessive internet use can further isolate individuals from the real world, creating a vicious cycle.

So, what can be done to address this growing problem? There are a number of effective treatments for internet addiction, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and **(38) family therapy**. Prevention is also key, and it is important to promote **(39) digital literacy** and responsible internet use from a young age. This can include educating young people about the potential risks of the internet and teaching them how to develop a healthy **(40) balance** with technology.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model Answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the average daily time spent on the internet by different age groups in the UK in two separate years, 2019 and 2022. Overall, it is immediately clear that internet usage increased across all age demographics over the three-year period. Furthermore, there is a consistent trend showing that younger people tend to spend more time online than their older counterparts.

In both years, the 16-24 age group recorded the highest average internet usage. In 2019, they spent 4.8 hours per day online, and this figure rose significantly to 6.2 hours in 2022. The 25-34 age group also demonstrated a substantial increase, from 4.2 hours in 2019 to 5.8 hours in 2022. This pattern of increased usage continues through the middle age groups, with the 35-44 and 45-54 brackets both showing a rise of approximately 1.4 hours per day.

The older age groups, while still showing an increase in internet usage, spent considerably less time online compared to the younger generations. The 55-64 age group’s average daily usage went up from 2.5 hours to 3.8 hours, while the 65+ group saw their usage increase from 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Despite this growth, the oldest age group still spent the least amount of time on the internet in both years.

### Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)

The pervasiveness of the internet in modern society has led to a significant debate regarding the issue of internet addiction. While some contend that this is a serious societal problem necessitating government intervention, others maintain that it is a matter of individual accountability. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

On the one hand, there is a compelling argument for government intervention in addressing internet addiction. Proponents of this view often draw parallels between internet addiction and other public health crises, such as smoking or gambling, where government regulation has proven effective. They argue that the internet, with its sophisticated algorithms designed to maximize user engagement, creates an environment where addiction can flourish. Therefore, it is the government's duty to protect its citizens, particularly vulnerable groups like children and adolescents, from the potential harms of excessive internet use. This could involve implementing measures such as mandatory age verification for certain websites, restrictions on online advertising, and funding for public awareness campaigns and treatment programs. The societal costs of untreated internet addiction, including decreased productivity, mental health problems, and social isolation, further strengthen the case for government action.

On the other hand, the argument for personal responsibility is equally persuasive. This perspective emphasizes individual autonomy and the right to make one's own choices. It posits that, in a free society, individuals are ultimately responsible for their own behavior, including their internet usage. Proponents of this view argue that government intervention would be an overreach of authority and could lead to censorship and a loss of personal freedom. They believe that education and self-regulation are more effective tools for promoting healthy internet habits. Individuals, they contend, should be empowered to develop the self-discipline and critical thinking skills necessary to navigate the digital world responsibly. Furthermore, they argue that what is considered 'addictive' can be highly subjective, and it would be difficult for the government to create a one-size-fits-all solution that respects individual differences.

In my opinion, while personal responsibility is paramount, the pervasive and manipulative nature of the internet necessitates a degree of government oversight. A balanced approach is required, one that combines education and public awareness campaigns with targeted regulations to curb the most exploitative aspects of the digital world. For instance, regulations could be introduced to increase the transparency of algorithms and to give users more control over their data and online experience. Ultimately, a collaborative effort between individuals, families, schools, and the government is needed to foster a culture of digital wellness and mitigate the risks of internet addiction.

### Speaking Part 2 Sample Response

I’d like to talk about a time when I took a break from the internet. This was about six months ago, during my university exams. I was finding it really difficult to concentrate on my studies because I was constantly distracted by my phone. I’d be in the middle of reading a textbook, and then I’d get a notification from Instagram or WhatsApp, and before I knew it, I’d have wasted half an hour scrolling through my phone.

I realized that my internet use was getting out of control and that it was having a negative impact on my academic performance. So, I decided to take a drastic step and go on a complete digital detox for a week. I deleted all the social media apps from my phone, and I even gave my smartphone to my parents and used an old-fashioned ‘dumb phone’ instead. It was really hard at first. I felt a bit lost and disconnected from the world. I kept reaching for my phone out of habit, only to remember that it wasn’t there.

During the break, I had so much more free time. I started reading for pleasure again, which is something I hadn’t done in years. I also went for long walks in the park and spent more quality time with my family and friends. I felt so much more present and engaged in the real world. By the end of the week, I felt like a different person. I was calmer, more focused, and I was sleeping much better. I did really well in my exams, and I’m sure that my digital detox played a big part in that. After the break, I reinstalled some of the social media apps on my phone, but I’m much more mindful of my internet use now. I’ve learned that it’s all about finding a healthy balance.
