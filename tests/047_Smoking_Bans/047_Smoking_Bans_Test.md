### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**Passage 1**

The implementation of smoking bans in public places has been a significant public health intervention of the 21st century. These policies, which restrict or prohibit smoking in venues such as restaurants, bars, and workplaces, are primarily designed to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. However, their impact extends beyond this initial objective, influencing smoking behaviors and contributing to a broader cultural shift in attitudes towards tobacco. This passage explores the multifaceted health benefits that have been observed following the introduction of smoking bans around the world.

One of the most immediate and measurable benefits of public smoking bans is the substantial reduction in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), also known as secondhand smoke. Numerous studies have demonstrated a dramatic decrease in air pollution in public spaces after smoking is prohibited. For instance, research conducted in bars and restaurants has shown a decline of over 80% in indoor air pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and carcinogens, following the enactment of smoke-free legislation. This reduction in ETS exposure translates directly into improved respiratory health for both hospitality workers and the general public. Employees in the hospitality sector, who were previously exposed to high concentrations of secondhand smoke for prolonged periods, have reported a significant decrease in respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, studies have documented a decline in hospital admissions for asthma and other respiratory illnesses in the months and years following the implementation of smoking bans.

Beyond the immediate respiratory benefits, smoking bans have been linked to a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Exposure to secondhand smoke is a known risk factor for heart attacks and other cardiac events. Research has consistently shown a decrease in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks) in communities that have implemented comprehensive smoking bans. A meta-analysis of studies from various countries found a 17% average reduction in heart attack hospitalizations after the introduction of smoke-free laws. This effect is particularly pronounced in the first year after a ban is enacted, highlighting the rapid positive impact of these policies on cardiovascular health.

The influence of smoking bans on smoking prevalence and cessation is another crucial aspect of their public health impact. While the primary goal is to protect non-smokers, these policies also create a supportive environment for smokers who want to quit. By making it more inconvenient to smoke, and by de-normalizing tobacco use, smoking bans can provide the motivation for individuals to reduce their cigarette consumption or to quit altogether. Studies have shown that the implementation of smoke-free workplaces is associated with a decrease in smoking prevalence among employees and a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked per day by those who continue to smoke. Although the effect on overall smoking prevalence at a national level can be more modest and may take longer to become apparent, the evidence suggests that smoking bans, as part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy, contribute to a decline in the number of smokers over time.

In conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the significant and wide-ranging health benefits of public smoking bans. From the immediate improvement in air quality and respiratory health to the long-term reduction in cardiovascular disease and smoking prevalence, these policies have proven to be a highly effective public health intervention. As more and more jurisdictions around the world adopt and strengthen smoke-free legislation, the global burden of tobacco-related disease is expected to continue to decline, leading to healthier populations and substantial healthcare savings.

A notable decrease in hospital admissions for 12. _______________ has also been observed. Furthermore, these bans create a supportive environment that can motivate smokers to quit, contributing to a decline in 13. _______________ over time.

**Passage 2**

The debate surrounding smoking bans is not limited to public health; it also encompasses a significant economic dimension. While proponents of smoke-free legislation emphasize the long-term healthcare savings and improved productivity, opponents, particularly those in the hospitality industry, often express concerns about potential financial losses. This passage examines the economic arguments and evidence related to the implementation of smoking bans.

**A**
One of the most contentious issues in the discourse on smoking bans is their financial effect on businesses, especially bars and restaurants. The core of this concern is the fear that prohibiting smoking will deter customers who smoke, leading to a decline in sales and, ultimately, business closures. This argument is predicated on the assumption that smokers will choose to stay at home or frequent establishments where smoking is permitted, rather than patronize a smoke-free venue. Several early studies, often funded by the tobacco industry, supported this view, reporting significant revenue losses for bars and restaurants following the implementation of smoking bans.

**B**
However, a larger body of independent research has produced contrasting findings. Numerous peer-reviewed studies, conducted across various countries and jurisdictions, have concluded that smoking bans do not have a negative impact on the hospitality industry. In fact, some studies have even reported a positive economic effect. These studies often use objective data, such as sales tax records, to assess the financial performance of businesses before and after a ban is introduced. The consensus from this body of evidence is that the hospitality sector, as a whole, does not suffer financially from the implementation of smoke-free policies.

**C**
Several factors may explain the discrepancy between the fears of business owners and the findings of independent research. Firstly, while some smokers may reduce their patronage of certain establishments, this loss of business is often offset by an increase in customers who prefer a smoke-free environment. Non-smokers, who may have previously avoided smoky bars and restaurants, are more likely to frequent these venues after a ban is in place. This shift in clientele can lead to a neutral or even positive net effect on sales.

**D**
Secondly, the economic impact of smoking bans can vary depending on the type of establishment. While some studies have found that bars and nightclubs that rely heavily on a smoking clientele may experience a temporary dip in revenue, this is not representative of the entire hospitality industry. Restaurants, particularly those that are family-oriented, are more likely to see a neutral or positive financial impact. Furthermore, the initial economic effects may be short-lived, as businesses and customers adapt to the new regulations over time.

**E**
Beyond the direct impact on the hospitality industry, smoking bans can have broader economic benefits. By reducing the prevalence of smoking-related illnesses, these policies can lead to significant long-term savings in healthcare costs. A healthier population also translates into a more productive workforce, with fewer sick days and lower rates of disability. Additionally, smoke-free environments can reduce cleaning and maintenance costs for businesses, as well as lower insurance premiums.

**F**
In conclusion, while the economic concerns of business owners are understandable, the weight of the evidence suggests that smoking bans do not have the dire financial consequences that are often feared. The initial anxieties about lost revenue are often not borne out by the data, and the broader economic benefits, such as reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity, are substantial. As with any public policy, there may be some businesses that are negatively affected in the short term, but the overall economic impact of smoking bans appears to be neutral to positive.

**Passage 3**

The movement to restrict smoking in public places is not a recent phenomenon. In fact, the history of smoking bans stretches back several centuries, reflecting a long and evolving struggle between individual freedoms, public health, and economic interests. This passage traces the historical trajectory of smoking bans, from their early religious origins to the comprehensive legislation of the modern era.

The earliest known prohibitions on smoking were not based on scientific evidence of health risks, but rather on moral and religious objections. In 1575, a Mexican ecclesiastical council forbade the use of tobacco in any church in Mexico and the Spanish colonies, marking one of the first recorded smoking bans. Pope Urban VII went a step further in 1590, threatening to excommunicate anyone who smoked in or near a church. These early bans were primarily concerned with the perceived profanity of tobacco use in sacred spaces.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, smoking bans began to appear in secular contexts, often driven by concerns about fire hazards. In 1633, the Ottoman Sultan Murad IV imposed a ban on smoking in his empire, with severe penalties for offenders. While this was partly motivated by a desire to maintain public order, the risk of fires in the largely wooden cities of the time was also a significant factor. Similarly, in many parts of Europe, smoking was prohibited in certain public buildings and workplaces, such as naval dockyards and arsenals, to prevent accidental explosions and fires.

The 19th century saw the rise of anti-tobacco movements, particularly in the United States and Great Britain. These movements, often linked to the temperance movement, campaigned against the use of tobacco on moral and social grounds. They argued that smoking was a vice that led to idleness, poverty, and moral decay. While these campaigns had some success in promoting voluntary abstinence from tobacco, they had limited impact on the enactment of widespread smoking bans.

It was not until the mid-20th century, with the emergence of compelling scientific evidence linking smoking to lung cancer and other diseases, that the modern anti-smoking movement began to gain momentum. The 1964 report of the U.S. Surgeon General, which definitively established the causal link between smoking and lung cancer, was a landmark moment in the history of tobacco control. This report, and the subsequent body of research that confirmed and expanded upon its findings, provided the scientific foundation for the public health argument for smoking bans.

The first comprehensive, modern smoking ban was enacted in the town of San Luis Obispo, California, in 1990. This ordinance prohibited smoking in all public buildings, including bars and restaurants, and became a model for similar legislation across the United States and around the world. In 2004, Ireland became the first country to implement a nationwide ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces. This bold move was soon followed by other countries, including Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, creating a domino effect that has led to the widespread adoption of smoke-free laws in many parts of the world.

Today, the global landscape of tobacco control is more complex than ever. While comprehensive smoking bans are now the norm in many developed countries, the battle against tobacco is far from over. The tobacco industry continues to challenge smoke-free legislation, and the rise of new products, such as e-cigarettes, presents new challenges for public health advocates. Nevertheless, the history of smoking bans demonstrates a clear trend towards greater restrictions on tobacco use, driven by a growing awareness of the devastating health consequences of smoking.

**David:** A hairdresser, right. So, you’re on your feet a lot. Now, let’s talk about your smoking habits. How many cigarettes would you say you smoke a day?

**Sarah:** I’d say, on average, about 15.

**David:** Fifteen. And how long have you been a smoker?

**Sarah:** For about 20 years now. Since I was a teenager.

**David:** I see. And have you tried to quit before?

**Sarah:** Yes, a couple of times. I think I’ve made about three serious attempts.

**David:** Three times. That’s good. It shows you’re motivated. What’s your main reason for wanting to quit this time?

**Sarah:** It’s mainly for my health. I’ve been getting out of breath more easily, and I’m worried about the long-term effects.

**David:** Health is a very strong motivator. Now, let’s think about a support plan. We have a few different options. Have you thought about what you’d like to use?

**Sarah:** I’ve heard that nicotine patches are good. And I’d like to try some sort of gum as well, for when the cravings are bad.

**David:** Patches and gum. An excellent combination. We can certainly arrange that for you. When would you like your quit date to be?

**Sarah:** I’m thinking of starting next Monday. That’s the 27th of January.

**David:** Monday the 27th. Perfect. We’ll set up weekly follow-up appointments for the first month. After that, we can reduce them to fortnightly. Is that okay?

**Sarah:** Yes, that sounds good.

**David:** And can I just take a contact number for you?

**Sarah:** Of course. It’s 07700 900 368.

**David:** 3-6-8. Great. And your email?

**Sarah:** It’s sarah.j@email.com.

**David:** Okay, that’s all the information I need for now. I’ll get the prescription for the patches and gum ready for you. Your next appointment will be with Dr. Evans, who will go through the medical side of things with you.

**Sarah:** Dr. Evans. Okay, great. Thank you.

**Section 2**

**(Scene: A community health talk. The speaker, Dr. Williams, is giving a presentation on the benefits of quitting smoking.)**

**Dr. Williams:** Good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining me tonight. My name is Dr. Williams, and I’m a public health specialist. Tonight, I want to talk to you about something that can dramatically improve your life: quitting smoking. While many people are aware that smoking is bad for them, not everyone understands the incredible and immediate benefits of stopping. The most significant of these, of course, is your long-term health. Quitting smoking is the single most important thing you can do to reduce your risk of cancer, heart disease, and a host of other chronic illnesses.

But the benefits start much sooner than you might think. In fact, your body begins to recover within minutes of your last cigarette. After just 20 minutes, your blood pressure and pulse rate start to return to normal. After 8 hours, the oxygen levels in your blood return to normal, and the harmful carbon monoxide levels are halved.

Within 48 hours, your ability to taste and smell will have improved. And after 72 hours, breathing becomes easier as your bronchial tubes begin to relax. The really significant improvements, however, come in the following weeks and months. Between 2 and 12 weeks, your circulation improves, making physical activity like walking and running much easier. Your lung function can increase by up to 10% in this time.

As you continue to stay smoke-free, the long-term benefits really kick in. After one year, your risk of a heart attack is halved compared to that of a smoker. After ten years, your risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker. And after 15 years, your risk of a heart attack is the same as someone who has never smoked.

Of course, quitting isn’t easy. You will likely experience some withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability, difficulty concentrating, and an increased appetite. These are all normal signs that your body is recovering. It’s important to have a plan to deal with these challenges.

Now, I’d like to briefly discuss some of the aids that can help you quit. Nicotine Replacement Therapy, or NRT, is a very popular choice. It comes in the form of patches, gum, lozenges, and sprays, and it works by giving you a low dose of nicotine without the other harmful chemicals in tobacco. Vaping or e-cigarettes are a more recent phenomenon. While they are considered to be less harmful than smoking, their long-term effects are still unknown, so their effectiveness as a quitting aid is not yet fully proven. Prescription medications, such as Champix or Zyban, are another option. These can be very effective, and they can be combined with other therapies, such as NRT, for a better chance of success. Finally, there are alternative therapies like hypnotherapy and acupuncture. While some people have found these helpful, their effectiveness is not yet fully proven by scientific studies. Support groups, on the other hand, can be a fantastic source of encouragement and motivation, and they can be combined with any of the other methods I’ve mentioned.

So, as you can see, there are many reasons to quit and many ways to do it. The most important thing is to make a plan and to stick to it. Thank you.

**Section 3**

**(Scene: Two university students, James and Maria, are discussing a presentation they need to prepare on anti-smoking campaigns.)**

**James:** So, Maria, we need to decide on the focus of our presentation on anti-smoking campaigns. There are so many different approaches, I’m not sure where to start.

**Maria:** I know what you mean. I’ve been looking at a few different types of campaigns. What do you think about the use of graphic warning labels on cigarette packs? I’ve seen some really shocking ones.

**James:** That’s an interesting idea. I read a study that suggested they can be effective, but they can also have a downside. Apparently, for some smokers, seeing those images can cause a defensive reaction, and they just block out the message.

**Maria:** That’s a good point. I hadn’t thought of that. What about tax increases? I know they’ve been used a lot. In my opinion, they are very effective because they particularly influence price-sensitive groups, like young people and those on low incomes.

**James:** I agree. The financial incentive is a powerful motivator. But what about mass media campaigns? The big TV adverts and billboards. They must have an impact.

**Maria:** They do, but I think the main problem with them is that their impact can be short-lived. People see them, they might think about quitting, but then the campaign ends and the motivation fades.

**James:** That’s true. I was reading about school-based education programs. They seem like a good long-term strategy, but the research I saw suggested that they are often less effective than community-wide initiatives. It’s hard to change behaviour if the wider environment doesn’t support it.

**Maria:** So, what do we think is the key to a successful campaign? It seems like there’s no single answer.

**James:** I think that’s the point. The most successful campaigns seem to be those that use a combination of different strategies. A bit of everything: tax increases, warning labels, media campaigns, and support for quitting.

**Maria:** I agree. We could also look at the role of social media. It’s a relatively new area for health promotion, but it seems like a cost-effective way to reach young people.

**James:** Definitely. And we shouldn’t forget the role of healthcare professionals. Doctors, in particular, have a crucial role in advising patients to quit. A simple piece of advice from a doctor can be a really powerful trigger for a quit attempt.

**Maria:** So, for our presentation, we could argue that future campaigns should be more comprehensive and tailored to specific groups. For example, using social media for young people, and focusing on direct advice from doctors for older smokers.

**James:** That sounds like a strong argument. We can use examples of different campaigns to support our points. So, the next step is to start gathering some specific examples and data.

**Maria:** Right. Let’s divide up the research. I’ll focus on tax increases and media campaigns, and you can look at warning labels and school programs.

**James:** Sounds good. Let’s meet again on Friday to discuss our findings.

**Section 4**

**(Scene: A university lecture on the history of tobacco advertising. The lecturer is Professor Davis.)**

**Professor Davis:** Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be looking at the history of tobacco advertising. It’s a fascinating and often controversial topic, and it provides a powerful case study of the evolution of marketing and public relations.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, tobacco was not the mass-market product it is today. Pre-rolled cigarettes were a luxury item, and the advertising of the time reflected this. The themes were of sophistication and glamour. Cigarettes were presented as a symbol of high social status, and the adverts often featured wealthy, well-dressed people in elegant surroundings.

The 1920s and 30s saw the rise of mass marketing, and the tobacco industry was at the forefront of this revolution. A key strategy was to target women, who had previously been a largely untapped market. Slogans and imagery were developed to link smoking with the modern, independent woman. The famous ‘Torches of Freedom’ campaign, for example, explicitly linked smoking with female emancipation.

During this period, we also see the use of doctors and dentists in advertising. This was a deliberate tactic to reassure the public about the safety of smoking. Adverts would feature slogans like ‘More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette’, creating a false sense of security and medical endorsement.

The 1950s and 60s were a turning point. The first major scientific reports linking smoking to lung cancer were published, and public awareness of the health risks began to grow. The tobacco industry responded not by withdrawing their products, but by creating doubt. They funded their own research institutes to produce conflicting evidence and to criticise the mainstream scientific consensus. This was also the era of the filter cigarette, which was marketed as a ‘safer’ option, a technological solution to the health concerns. The focus of advertising shifted from health claims to an emphasis on flavour and enjoyment.

The regulatory backlash began in the 1970s. In many countries, television and radio advertising of tobacco products was banned. This forced the industry to find new ways to promote their products. We see the introduction of health warnings on packaging, although initially these were often small and easy to ignore. The industry shifted its focus to print media, billboards, and, most significantly, sponsorship. Sporting events, in particular, became a major vehicle for tobacco promotion.

In the 21st century, with ever-tighter restrictions on advertising in developed countries, the tobacco industry has become more creative. We see the rise of ‘dark advertising’, which involves subtle marketing at the point of sale, such as branded displays and special offers. The internet has also provided new opportunities for promotion, with the use of social media and influencers to reach young people. Packaging itself has become a key marketing tool, with sleek, attractive designs that appeal to a sense of style and identity.

The industry also continues to innovate in its efforts to fight against stricter regulations. And the ultimate goal of all this activity is to normalise smoking for the next generation, to ensure a continued supply of new customers. It’s a constant battle between public health and corporate interests, and it’s a battle that is far from over.

## TUTOR GUIDE

**Model Answer for Writing Task 1**

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of adults who smoked in five different countries for the years 2000 and 2020. Overall, there was a discernible downward trend in the percentage of smokers in all the countries surveyed, with the most significant decrease observed in the USA.

In 2000, the USA had the highest percentage of adult smokers, at approximately 35%. However, this figure experienced a dramatic fall of 20 percentage points to 15% by 2020, the most substantial decline among the five nations. Similarly, the UK and Germany also witnessed a considerable reduction in their smoking populations. The UK’s smoking rate fell from 30% to 18%, while Germany’s decreased from 28% to 17%.

France and China also saw a decline in the percentage of adult smokers, albeit a less pronounced one. In France, the figure dropped from 25% in 2000 to 19% in 2020. China, which had the lowest smoking rate of the five countries in 2000 at 22%, saw a modest decrease of 4 percentage points to 18% in 2020. By 2020, the smoking rates in the UK, Germany, France, and China had all converged to a similar range of 17-19%.

**Model Essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)**

The debate over a complete ban on tobacco products encapsulates a fundamental conflict between public health and individual liberty. While the devastating health consequences of smoking provide a compelling argument for prohibition, the principles of personal autonomy and the practical challenges of enforcement demand equal consideration. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering a concluding viewpoint.

Proponents of a total ban on tobacco rightly point to the extensive and irrefutable evidence of its harmful effects. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death worldwide, responsible for a plethora of diseases including cancer, heart disease, and chronic respiratory conditions. A complete prohibition, it is argued, would be the most effective way to eradicate this public health crisis, saving millions of lives and alleviating the immense burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, the addictive nature of nicotine undermines the argument for personal choice, as many smokers are not freely choosing to smoke but are instead compelled by their addiction. From this perspective, a ban is not an infringement of liberty but a necessary intervention to protect individuals from a highly addictive and deadly product.

Conversely, opponents of a ban argue that it represents an unacceptable overreach of state power into the lives of private citizens. In a free society, adults should have the right to make their own choices, even if those choices are risky. As long as smokers are not harming others, the state has no right to dictate their personal habits. Moreover, the practicalities of enforcing a complete ban would be fraught with difficulty. The prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 20th century demonstrated that such measures can lead to the emergence of a dangerous black market, an increase in organised crime, and a loss of tax revenue for the government. A similar outcome could be expected from a ban on tobacco, with unregulated and potentially more dangerous products being sold illegally.

In my opinion, while the arguments for a complete ban are understandable from a public health standpoint, the infringement on personal freedom and the likely negative consequences of prohibition make it an unviable policy. A more balanced and effective approach is to continue with a comprehensive strategy of tobacco control, including high taxes, smoke-free legislation, graphic health warnings, and extensive support for those who wish to quit. These measures respect individual autonomy while creating an environment that discourages smoking and supports public health. Ultimately, education and empowerment are more powerful tools than prohibition in the long-term effort to create a smoke-free society.

**Speaking Part 2 Sample Response**

(Where you were)
I’d like to talk about a time I was in a place where smoking was not allowed. It was a few years ago, when I was on holiday in Ireland. I was with my family, and we had decided to go out for a traditional Irish meal in a pub in Dublin. I remember being really excited about it, as I’d heard so much about the lively atmosphere of Irish pubs.

(What you were doing)
We found a lovely old pub in the city centre. It was a very traditional place, with dark wood panelling and a real fire. We ordered our food and drinks and settled down to enjoy the evening. There was live music playing, and the pub was full of people chatting and laughing. It was a fantastic atmosphere.

(How you felt about the no-smoking rule)
What really struck me was that, despite being a pub, there was no smoking allowed inside. At first, I was a bit surprised, as in my country at the time, smoking was still very common in pubs. But I have to say, I felt really positive about the no-smoking rule. The air was clean, and I could actually smell the food and the peat from the fire. It was so much more pleasant than being in a smoky, stuffy environment. I remember thinking how much more I was enjoying the experience because of the clean air.

(And explain why you think the rule was in place)
I think the rule was in place for a couple of reasons. Firstly, and most importantly, it was to protect the health of the staff and the other customers. Secondhand smoke is a serious health risk, and the ban was a way of creating a safer and healthier environment for everyone. Secondly, I think it was also about changing the culture around smoking. By making it illegal to smoke in public places, the government was sending a clear message that smoking is not a socially acceptable habit. It was a really progressive policy, and it’s one that has since been adopted by many other countries, including my own.
