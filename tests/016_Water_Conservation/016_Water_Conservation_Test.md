### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**PASSAGE 1**

The intrinsic value of water is undeniable, yet its finite nature is a concept often overlooked in daily life. The casual turn of a faucet, the long, leisurely shower, and the verdant expanse of a suburban lawn all contribute to a collective consumption pattern that is becoming increasingly unsustainable. As the global population continues to expand and the impacts of climate change intensify, the imperative to conserve water has never been more critical. The consequences of inaction are stark, ranging from localized water shortages to widespread ecosystem collapse. Therefore, a concerted effort, from individual households to national governments, is essential to safeguard this precious resource for future generations.

At the household level, the bathroom is the primary frontier for water conservation, accounting for over half of all indoor water use. Simple behavioral adjustments, such as turning off the tap while brushing teeth or shaving, can yield significant water savings over time. Shortening shower times, even by a few minutes, can also have a substantial impact. Technological solutions further amplify these savings. The installation of WaterSense labeled fixtures, for instance, can reduce water consumption by 20% or more without compromising performance. These high-efficiency toilets, showerheads, and faucets are independently certified to meet rigorous standards for both water savings and quality, making them a reliable choice for the eco-conscious consumer.

The kitchen and laundry room are also key areas for water conservation. In the kitchen, the dishwasher is often a more water-efficient option than handwashing, particularly when run with a full load. Simple practices like scraping plates instead of rinsing them and keeping a pitcher of cold water in the refrigerator can further reduce water waste. In the laundry room, washing only full loads of clothes or selecting the appropriate water level for smaller loads are effective strategies for minimizing water consumption.

Outdoor water use, which can account for up to 70% of household water consumption in some regions, presents another significant opportunity for conservation. The creation of water-smart landscapes, featuring drought-tolerant native plants and efficient irrigation systems, can dramatically reduce the need for supplemental watering. Simple maintenance practices, such as sweeping driveways and sidewalks instead of hosing them down, also contribute to a more sustainable approach to outdoor water use.

The cumulative impact of these individual actions is substantial, but a broader, more systemic approach is necessary to address the global water crisis. Governments and international organizations play a crucial role in promoting water conservation through policy, education, and infrastructure investment. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has outlined a multi-pronged strategy to address global water shortages, emphasizing the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems, the improvement of water efficiency in agriculture, and the development of unconventional water sources.

Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, such as wetlands and forests, is fundamental to maintaining healthy watersheds and ensuring a stable supply of fresh water. These ecosystems act as natural filters and reservoirs, and their degradation has severe consequences for water quality and availability. In the agricultural sector, which accounts for 70% of global freshwater use, the adoption of water-saving technologies like drip irrigation and hydroponics is essential. Additionally, addressing water leaks in municipal infrastructure and promoting the use of treated wastewater and harvested rainwater can help to augment water supplies.

Ultimately, a sustainable water future requires a paradigm shift in our collective relationship with water. It demands a recognition of water as a finite and precious resource, and a commitment to its conservation at every level of society. From the simple act of turning off a tap to the complex challenge of managing transboundary water resources, every effort contributes to a more water-secure world.

**PASSAGE 2**

**The Unseen Threat: Water Scarcity and its Global Impact**

**A**
Water scarcity is a more nuanced issue than the simple absence of water. It can be categorized into two distinct types: physical scarcity and economic scarcity. Physical water scarcity is the result of a region's demand for water exceeding its available supply. This is often the case in arid and semi-arid regions, where low rainfall and high temperatures create a challenging environment for water resource management. However, physical scarcity is not limited to dry climates. It can also be induced by population growth, urbanization, and increased water consumption for agriculture and industry. As more people compete for a finite resource, the per capita availability of water decreases, leading to stress on existing water systems.

**B**
Economic water scarcity, on the other hand, is not a result of a lack of water, but rather a lack of investment in water infrastructure and management. In many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, there is sufficient water to meet the needs of the population, but the means to access and distribute it are inadequate. This can be due to a variety of factors, including poverty, political instability, and a lack of technical expertise. The consequences of economic water scarcity are just as severe as those of physical scarcity, leading to poor sanitation, disease, and a diminished quality of life.

**C**
Agriculture is by far the largest consumer of freshwater globally, accounting for approximately 70% of all water withdrawals. The increasing demand for food to feed a growing global population has put immense pressure on water resources. Traditional irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation, are often inefficient, with a significant portion of the water lost to evaporation and runoff. The cultivation of water-intensive crops in arid regions further exacerbates the problem. To address this challenge, a shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices is essential. This includes the adoption of water-saving technologies like drip irrigation and precision sprinklers, as well as the cultivation of drought-resistant crop varieties.

**D**
The impacts of water scarcity are far-reaching, extending beyond the immediate challenges of thirst and sanitation. Water is a critical input for many industries, including energy production, manufacturing, and mining. A lack of water can disrupt industrial processes, leading to economic losses and job cuts. In the energy sector, for example, water is used for cooling in thermal power plants and for hydropower generation. Water scarcity can therefore have a direct impact on a country's energy security.

**E**
The social and political consequences of water scarcity can be equally severe. Competition for limited water resources can lead to social unrest and conflict, both within and between countries. The concept of "water wars" has been a topic of discussion for decades, and while large-scale conflicts over water have been rare, tensions are rising in many parts of the world. The management of transboundary water resources, such as rivers and lakes that are shared by multiple countries, is a particularly complex challenge that requires a high degree of international cooperation.

**F**
Addressing the global water crisis requires a multi-faceted approach that combines technological innovation, policy reform, and a fundamental shift in our collective attitude towards water. Technological solutions, such as desalination and wastewater recycling, can help to augment water supplies, but they are often energy-intensive and expensive. Policy reforms, such as water pricing and the establishment of water markets, can create incentives for more efficient water use. Ultimately, however, a sustainable water future depends on a shared understanding of the value of water and a collective commitment to its conservation.

**PASSAGE 3**

As the global water crisis intensifies, traditional conservation methods, while still essential, are proving insufficient to meet the growing demand for this finite resource. The urgency of the situation has spurred a wave of innovation, with scientists and engineers developing cutting-edge technologies designed to revolutionize water management and conservation. From the microscopic realm of nanotechnology to the vast computational power of artificial intelligence, these advancements offer a glimmer of hope in the quest for a sustainable water future.

Nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale, is emerging as a powerful tool in water purification and treatment. Materials at the nanoscale exhibit unique properties that can be harnessed to create highly efficient and selective filtration systems. Nanofiltration membranes, for example, are capable of removing a wide range of contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and even micropollutants that are resistant to conventional treatment methods. Furthermore, nanoparticles such as graphene oxide have shown great promise in adsorbing pollutants from water, effectively acting as microscopic sponges that can be used to clean contaminated water sources.

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data analytics is transforming the way we manage water resources. By collecting and analyzing vast datasets from sensors, weather forecasts, and consumption patterns, AI-powered systems can optimize the distribution of water, predict demand, and identify leaks in real-time. In many urban areas, a significant portion of the water supply is lost through aging and leaky infrastructure. AI-driven acoustic sensors and predictive models can pinpoint the location of these leaks with remarkable accuracy, enabling rapid repairs and preventing the loss of millions of gallons of water. This proactive approach to maintenance not only conserves water but also reduces the operational costs for water utilities.

Smart irrigation systems represent another significant leap forward in water conservation, particularly in the agricultural sector, which is the largest consumer of freshwater globally. These systems use a network of sensors to monitor soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant needs, delivering water only when and where it is needed. This precision approach to irrigation can reduce water use by up to 50% compared to traditional methods, while also improving crop yields. By optimizing water use in agriculture, smart irrigation technologies can help to alleviate the pressure on freshwater resources and enhance food security.

Desalination, the process of removing salt from seawater, has long been considered a potential solution to water scarcity, particularly in coastal regions. However, traditional desalination methods are energy-intensive and produce a toxic brine that can harm marine ecosystems. Recent innovations in desalination technology, such as reverse osmosis and membrane distillation, are making the process more efficient and environmentally friendly. While desalination is not a silver bullet, it is becoming an increasingly viable option for augmenting water supplies in water-stressed regions.

The journey towards a water-secure future will undoubtedly be challenging, but the rapid pace of technological innovation provides reason for optimism. These emerging technologies, from the nanoscale to the global scale, offer a diverse toolkit for addressing the complex challenges of water scarcity. However, technology alone is not enough. A holistic approach that combines technological innovation with policy reform, public education, and a fundamental shift in our collective valuation of water is essential to ensure that this precious resource is managed sustainably for generations to come.

**Water Conservation Officer:** And for the bathroom, a simple and effective measure is to install a low-flow **(10) showerhead**. It can reduce your water consumption by up to 50%.

**Sarah:** Wow, that's a big saving!

**Water Conservation Officer:** Yes, it can make a real difference. Our consultant will be able to provide you with more information and a list of recommended products during the consultation.

**Sarah:** That's great. Thank you for your help.

**Water Conservation Officer:** You're welcome. We'll see you on Tuesday at 10 am.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Greendale Community Garden. My name is Tom, and I'm the volunteer coordinator here. It's great to see so many of you interested in our little oasis in the city. The garden was started five years ago by a group of local residents who wanted to create a space where people could come together and **(11) grow their own food**. We've come a long way since then, and we now have over 50 plots, a greenhouse, and a thriving community of gardeners.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that is very important to us here at the garden, and that is **(12) water conservation**. As you know, we've been experiencing a prolonged drought, and the council has introduced **(13) water restrictions**. This means we have to be very careful with our water use, and we've implemented a number of measures to ensure that we're using water as efficiently as possible.

One of the key features of our garden is our **(14) drip irrigation system**. This system delivers water directly to the roots of the plants, which minimizes water loss through evaporation. It's a bit more expensive to install than a traditional sprinkler system, but it's much more efficient in the long run. We also have a rainwater harvesting system, which collects rainwater from the roof of the greenhouse and stores it in a large tank. We use this water to supplement our main water supply, and it's a great way to reduce our reliance on mains water.

We're always looking for new ways to save water, and we're currently running a series of workshops on water conservation in the garden. I'd encourage you all to **(15) attend one of these workshops** to learn more about how you can save water in your own gardens.

Now, I'd like to give you a few tips on how you can be more water-wise in your own gardening practices. When it comes to **(16) watering**, it's best to water in the early morning or late evening, as this is when evaporation is at its lowest. For **(17) plant selection**, I'd recommend choosing drought-tolerant plants that are adapted to our local climate. They require less water and are easier to care for. **(18) Mulching** is another great way to save water. A thick layer of mulch will help to retain moisture in the soil and reduce the need for watering. And finally, I'd encourage you to install a **(19) rainwater harvesting system** in your own garden. It's a simple and effective way to collect and store rainwater for use in your garden. And don't forget to regularly check your irrigation system for any leaks to ensure it's working efficiently. So, for **(20) system maintenance**, it's crucial to check for leaks.

**SECTION 3**

**Maria:** So, David, we've been asked to prepare a presentation on the social and economic aspects of water scarcity. Where should we start?

**David:** Well, I think we should start by defining what we mean by water scarcity. It's not just about a lack of water, but also about a lack of access to water. And that's where the social and economic factors come in.

**Maria:** Right. So, we could talk about the difference between physical and economic water scarcity. And then we could look at some of the social and economic impacts of water scarcity, such as poverty, disease, and conflict.

**David:** Exactly. And we should also discuss some of the potential solutions. I've been reading about the role of technology in water management, and there are some really interesting innovations out there.

**Maria:** Yes, but we need to be careful not to focus too much on the technology. I think it's important to also consider the social and political challenges of implementing these new technologies. For example, the **(22) high cost of implementation** can be a major barrier in developing countries.

**David:** That's a good point. And we should also talk about the role of policy and governance. For example, **(23) water pricing** can be an effective tool for encouraging water conservation, but it can also have a negative impact on low-income households if it's not designed properly.

**Maria:** And what about **(24) water privatization**? That's a really controversial topic. Some people argue that it leads to more efficient water management, but others say that it can have negative social consequences, such as increased prices and a lack of access for the poor.

**David:** We should definitely include a section on that. And we should also talk about the importance of **(25) public education**. I think it's crucial to change people's attitudes towards water use and to promote a culture of conservation.

**Maria:** I agree. And we should also mention the role of **(26) international cooperation**, especially when it comes to managing shared water resources. The Nile, for example, is shared by eleven countries, and they all have to work together to ensure that the river is managed sustainably.

**David:** That's a great example. And we could also look at some case studies of successful water management. I was reading about **(27) Singapore's NEWater program**, which is a really innovative way of recycling wastewater.

**Maria:** Oh, yes, I've heard about that. It's a great example of how technology can be used to augment water supplies. And what about **(28) desalination**? It's becoming more and more common, but it's still very energy-intensive and can have a negative impact on the environment.

**David:** I think we should present it as a promising technology that is becoming more sustainable, but not a silver bullet. So, to sum up, we're going to talk about the different types of water scarcity, the social and economic impacts, and a range of solutions, including technological innovation, policy reform, and public education. And we'll use case studies to illustrate our points.

**Maria:** I think that's a great plan. We need to emphasize that a **(29) holistic approach** is needed, one that combines technological, social, and political strategies.

**David:** Exactly. The main conclusion of our presentation should be that there is no single solution to the global water crisis, but that a **(30) combination of strategies** is needed to ensure a sustainable water future.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the history of water management. Water has always been a critical resource for human civilization, and the way we manage it has evolved significantly over time.

Early civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, settled near rivers for **(31) agriculture** and transportation. They developed sophisticated irrigation systems to water their crops, and they built canals and reservoirs to store and distribute water. The Romans were particularly famous for their engineering skills, and they built impressive **(32) aqueducts** and sanitation systems that are still admired today. The development of **(33) irrigation** was a key factor in the expansion of agriculture and the growth of cities.

The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries brought about a massive increase in **(34) population** and industrial production. This led to a huge demand for water, and it also resulted in widespread **(35) pollution** of rivers and lakes. The spread of diseases like cholera and typhoid was a major problem in industrial cities, and the concept of public health emerged in response to these challenges.

In the 20th century, the focus of water management shifted to the construction of large-scale **(36) dams** and irrigation projects. These projects were designed to provide water for agriculture, industry, and growing cities, and they had a significant impact on the environment. The construction of dams, for example, often resulted in the displacement of communities and the alteration of **(37) ecosystems**. The Green Revolution in the mid-20th century led to a dramatic increase in food production, but it also led to a huge increase in **(38) water consumption**.

In the 21st century, the focus of water management is on **(39) conservation** and sustainability. There is a growing recognition of the need for a more **(40) integrated approach** to water management, one that takes into account the social, economic, and environmental aspects of water use. This includes a focus on water conservation, efficiency, and the use of unconventional water sources, such as wastewater recycling and desalination. The challenges are immense, but so are the opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of water consumed by three different sectors—agriculture, industry, and domestic use—in a specific country in the years 2010 and 2020.

Overall, the agricultural sector was the largest consumer of water in both years, although its share of water use decreased over the decade. In contrast, the proportions of water used by the industrial and domestic sectors both increased.

In 2010, agriculture accounted for 70% of all water consumption. This figure fell to 60% in 2020, a decrease of 10 percentage points. Despite this reduction, agriculture remained the dominant water user in the country.

The industrial sector’s share of water consumption rose from 20% in 2010 to 25% in 2020. Similarly, the proportion of water used by the domestic sector increased from 10% to 15% over the same period. The combined share of water use for industry and domestic purposes grew from 30% in 2010 to 40% in 2020, indicating a shift in water consumption patterns away from agriculture and towards other sectors.

### Model essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)

The escalating global water crisis has prompted a debate about the most effective approach to conservation. While some contend that stringent government regulations are the key to solving the problem, others maintain that the onus is on individuals to conserve water. This essay will discuss both perspectives before arguing that a combination of government intervention and individual responsibility is essential to address this complex issue.

On the one hand, there is a strong case to be made for government-imposed regulations. Proponents of this view argue that the scale of the water crisis is too vast to be tackled by individual actions alone. Governments have the power to enact and enforce policies that can have a far-reaching impact, such as setting mandatory water efficiency standards for appliances, imposing quotas on industrial and agricultural water use, and investing in large-scale infrastructure projects like desalination plants and wastewater treatment facilities. For example, the successful implementation of water pricing policies in some countries has demonstrated that economic incentives can be a powerful tool for encouraging conservation on a national scale. Without such top-down measures, it is argued, any individual efforts would be insufficient to bring about the systemic change that is required.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that individual actions play a crucial role in water conservation. The cumulative effect of millions of people making small changes in their daily habits can be substantial. Simple measures such as taking shorter showers, fixing leaky faucets, and choosing water-efficient appliances can significantly reduce household water consumption. Furthermore, a culture of conservation, fostered through education and public awareness campaigns, can lead to a fundamental shift in societal attitudes towards water use. When individuals understand the value of water and the consequences of its waste, they are more likely to adopt sustainable practices and to support government policies aimed at conservation.

In my opinion, neither government regulation nor individual responsibility alone is sufficient to solve the global water crisis. A synergistic approach, in which government policies create a framework for conservation and individuals are empowered and motivated to act, is the most effective way forward. Governments should take the lead in setting clear targets and creating a level playing field, but they must also engage with citizens and communities to ensure that conservation efforts are embraced at the grassroots level. Ultimately, a shared sense of responsibility is the only way to ensure a sustainable water future for all.

### Speaking Part 2 sample response

I remember a time a few years ago when I was on holiday in a small coastal town. It was the middle of summer, and there was a severe drought in the region. The local authorities had put up signs everywhere, urging people to save water. However, one evening, I was walking past a large hotel, and I saw something that really shocked me. The hotel had a huge, lush green lawn, and there were sprinklers going at full blast, watering the grass in the middle of the day. I couldn't believe it. There were puddles of water forming on the pavement, and the water was just running down the street and into the drain. It was such a blatant waste of water, especially given the circumstances. I felt really angry and frustrated. It seemed so unfair that the local residents were being asked to make sacrifices while this big hotel was just ignoring the rules. I thought about reporting it to the authorities, but I wasn't sure who to contact. It really made me think about the different attitudes that people have towards water conservation and the challenges of enforcing regulations.
