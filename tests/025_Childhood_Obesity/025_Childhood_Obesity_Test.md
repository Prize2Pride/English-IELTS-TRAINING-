### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Childhood Obesity Epidemic**

Childhood obesity has emerged as one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century, affecting both developed and developing nations. The prevalence of overweight and obese children has increased at an alarming rate, with global estimates suggesting over 42 million overweight children under the age of five in 2010, a number that has continued to grow. This trend is particularly concerning as overweight and obese children are highly likely to remain so into adulthood, predisposing them to a range of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions at a much younger age.

The development of obesity is a complex issue with a multifactorial etiology. While an increase in caloric and fat intake is a primary contributor, the modern environment plays a pivotal role. Lifestyle preferences, cultural norms, and environmental factors all contribute to the rising rates of obesity worldwide. For instance, the excessive consumption of sugary soft drinks, larger portion sizes, and a steady decline in physical activity are major drivers of this epidemic. The intricate interplay of these factors makes understanding and combating childhood obesity a formidable challenge.

Childhood obesity extends its impact beyond physical health, profoundly affecting a child's social and emotional well-being and self-esteem. The condition is often associated with poor academic performance and a diminished quality of life. Children with obesity may face social stigmatization, leading to feelings of isolation and withdrawal. This can create a vicious cycle, where children retreat to the safety of their homes and seek comfort in food, further exacerbating their weight issues. The lack of social interaction and play often results in a more sedentary lifestyle, contributing to further weight gain.

The physical health consequences of childhood obesity are extensive and can be severe. Many conditions previously seen only in adults are now prevalent in obese children. These include Type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, asthma, and fatty liver disease. Furthermore, children with obesity may experience orthopedic problems, menstrual abnormalities, and impaired balance. While many of these conditions are preventable and can resolve with weight management, some may have lasting negative effects into adulthood, and in the most severe cases, can even be fatal.

Recognizing the symptoms of childhood obesity is not always straightforward. It is not merely a matter of a child appearing overweight, as body frames and developmental stages can vary. Healthcare professionals utilize the Body Mass Index (BMI), which compares a child's weight and height to that of other children of the same age and sex, to assess for overweight and obese status. However, BMI is just one tool, and a comprehensive evaluation should include growth patterns, eating and activity habits, and family history to determine if a child's weight poses health risks.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Role of Schools in Combating Childhood Obesity**

**A**
With the incidence of childhood obesity reaching epidemic proportions, the role of schools in health promotion has become a critical area of focus. Schools are in a unique position to influence the health and well-being of children, as they are where children spend a significant portion of their day. More than 95% of American youth aged five to seventeen are enrolled in school, making it an ideal setting for implementing strategies to prevent and manage obesity. By creating a healthy school environment, educational institutions can play a pivotal role in fostering lifelong healthy habits.

**B**
One of the primary ways schools can contribute to the fight against childhood obesity is through the provision of nutritious meals. School cafeterias can be transformed into environments that promote healthy eating by offering a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. It is not enough to simply provide healthy options; schools must also make them appealing to children. This can be achieved through creative food presentation, taste tests, and involving students in the menu planning process. Furthermore, restricting the availability of unhealthy options, such as sugary drinks and high-fat snacks, in vending machines and school stores is a crucial step in promoting a healthy food environment.

**C**
Nutrition education is another vital component of a school-based approach to obesity prevention. This education should be integrated into the curriculum and go beyond simply teaching children about food groups. It should equip them with the practical skills to make healthy choices, such as reading food labels, understanding portion sizes, and preparing simple, healthy meals. Effective nutrition education can empower children to become advocates for their own health and to make informed decisions about the food they consume both in and out of school.

**D**
In addition to promoting healthy eating, schools have a responsibility to ensure that children are physically active. Regular physical education classes are essential, but they are often not enough to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity for children. Schools can incorporate physical activity into the school day in various ways, such as through classroom-based activity breaks, after-school sports programs, and promoting active transport to and from school, such as walking or cycling. Creating a school culture that values and encourages physical activity is key to getting children moving.

**E**
Creating a supportive and inclusive school environment is also crucial. Children who are overweight or obese are often subjected to teasing and bullying, which can have a devastating impact on their self-esteem and mental health. Schools must implement and enforce anti-bullying policies that specifically address weight-based teasing. By fostering a culture of respect and acceptance, schools can help to create a safe and supportive environment where all children feel valued, regardless of their weight.

**F**
The collaboration between schools, parents, and the wider community is essential for the success of any school-based obesity prevention program. Schools can act as a hub for health promotion, but their efforts will be much more effective if they are reinforced at home and in the community. Parent-teacher associations can be a valuable forum for discussing and implementing healthy initiatives. Engaging local businesses to support healthy school activities and working with community organizations to provide opportunities for physical activity outside of school hours can create a comprehensive and sustainable approach to tackling childhood obesity.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Psychological Scars of Childhood Obesity**

The physical health consequences of childhood obesity are well-documented, but the psychological and emotional toll it takes on a child can be just as, if not more, damaging. The experience of being an overweight or obese child can lead to a range of psychological issues, including depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and a negative body image. These issues can have a lasting impact on a child's development and well-being, often persisting into adulthood.

One of the most significant psychological consequences of childhood obesity is the experience of weight-based stigmatization and discrimination. Children who are overweight are frequently subjected to teasing, bullying, and social exclusion by their peers. This can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, and worthlessness. The constant barrage of negative comments and attitudes can erode a child's self-esteem and lead to social withdrawal. In an effort to protect themselves from further emotional pain, overweight children may isolate themselves, avoiding social situations and physical activities, which can, in turn, exacerbate their weight problem.

The media also plays a role in shaping societal attitudes towards weight and body image, often perpetuating unrealistic and narrow beauty standards. Children are bombarded with images of thin, idealized bodies, which can lead to body dissatisfaction and a negative self-perception among those who do not fit this mold. This can be particularly damaging during adolescence, a time of heightened self-consciousness and identity formation. The pressure to conform to these unrealistic ideals can contribute to the development of disordered eating patterns and a preoccupation with weight.

Depression is another common psychological comorbidity of childhood obesity. The chronic stress of dealing with weight-based teasing, social isolation, and a negative body image can take a toll on a child's mental health. Studies have shown that obese children are at a significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms compared to their normal-weight peers. The symptoms of depression, such as low mood, loss of interest in activities, and changes in appetite and sleep patterns, can further compound the challenges of managing weight and can have a profound impact on a child's overall quality of life.

Anxiety disorders are also more prevalent among obese children. The fear of being judged or ridiculed can lead to social anxiety, making it difficult for children to participate in school and other social activities. They may also experience generalized anxiety, worrying excessively about their health, their appearance, and their future. This constant state of anxiety can be emotionally draining and can interfere with a child's ability to concentrate and learn.

Addressing the psychological consequences of childhood obesity is a critical component of comprehensive care. It is not enough to simply focus on diet and exercise; the emotional and mental health of the child must also be a priority. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves pediatricians, mental health professionals, and school personnel. Creating a supportive and non-judgmental environment where children feel safe to express their feelings and concerns is essential. Interventions that focus on building self-esteem, developing coping skills, and promoting a positive body image can help to mitigate the negative psychological effects of obesity and empower children to lead healthier and happier lives.

**Community Health Worker:** Okay, I've made a note of that. We'll make sure there are no nuts in any of the snacks provided. You're all registered, Sarah. We look forward to seeing you and your son at the workshop.

**Sarah:** Thank you so much.

**SECTION 2**

**Nutritionist:** Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our talk on healthy eating. My name is Dr. Evans, and I'm a nutritionist. Today, I want to talk to you about a simple tool that can help you make healthier food choices: the 'Eat Well Plate'. You may remember the old Food Pyramid, but the 'Eat Well Plate' has now replaced it as the main guide to a healthy, balanced diet. The plate is divided into sections, each representing a different food group. The size of each section shows how much of that food group you should be eating.

The main message of the 'Eat Well Plate' is to eat a balanced and varied diet. It's not about cutting out any food groups completely, but about getting the proportions right. The largest section of the plate, making up just over a third of it, is dedicated to **fruit and vegetables**. You should aim to eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or juiced. The next largest section, also just over a third, is for **starchy foods** like potatoes, bread, rice, and pasta. It's best to choose wholegrain varieties whenever you can, as they contain more **fibre**, which is great for your digestive health.

Next, we have the **protein** section, which includes beans, pulses, fish, eggs, and meat. These are important for growth and repair. You should aim for two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily, like salmon or mackerel. Then there's the **dairy and alternatives** section, which includes milk, cheese, and yogurt. These are a good source of calcium for strong bones. Try to choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options where possible. Finally, the smallest section is for **oils and spreads**. It's important to choose unsaturated oils, like olive or rapeseed oil, and to use them in small amounts.

So, to recap the recommendations for each food group: for **fruit and vegetables**, you should eat a wide variety. For **dairy and alternatives**, choose lower-fat and lower-sugar options. For **beans, pulses, fish, eggs, and meat**, aim for at least two portions of fish a week. For **oils and spreads**, choose unsaturated oils. And for **foods high in fat, salt, and sugar**, you should limit your consumption to small amounts. By following the 'Eat Well Plate', you can ensure you're getting a healthy, balanced diet.

**SECTION 3**

**Tutor:** So, James and Chloe, you're going to present your findings on the study about parenting styles and childhood obesity. How are you getting on?

**James:** We've done a lot of reading, and we think we have a good understanding of the study.

**Chloe:** Yes, the study looked at the link between different **parenting styles** and the risk of childhood obesity. The main finding was that a **permissive parenting** style, where parents are very lenient and don't set many rules, is associated with a higher risk of a child becoming obese.

**Tutor:** And what about the other parenting styles?

**James:** The study also looked at authoritative and authoritarian parenting. **Authoritative parents**, who are responsive to their child's needs but also have clear expectations and boundaries, seemed to have the best outcomes in terms of preventing obesity.

**Chloe:** We found the definitions of the parenting styles a bit confusing at first, but the study provided clear criteria. For example, it defined 'screen time' as any time spent watching TV, playing video games, or using a computer for leisure. We thought that was a bit **broad**, as it doesn't distinguish between different types of screen time.

**Tutor:** That's a good point. What did you think were the limitations of the study?

**James:** Well, a major limitation was that it relied on **self-reported data**. Parents had to report on their own parenting style and their child's diet and physical activity levels, which can be unreliable.

**Chloe:** We thought that future research should use more **objective measures**, like accelerometers to track physical activity, or have trained observers assess parenting styles.

**Tutor:** Excellent. And have you thought about the role of culture in all of this?

**James:** Yes, the tutor mentioned that. We realized that parenting styles can be heavily influenced by **cultural norms**, and what is considered 'authoritative' in one culture might be seen as too strict or too lenient in another.

**Chloe:** So, we're planning to include a section in our presentation on **practical recommendations** for parents, but we'll make sure to emphasize that these need to be adapted to different cultural contexts.

**Tutor:** That sounds like a very thoughtful approach. Remember to be **critical** of the study's methodology in your presentation, but also to highlight its strengths. And you'll be presenting this to the **rest of the class**, so make sure it's engaging and easy to understand.

**James:** We will. Thanks for your help.

**SECTION 4**

**Lecturer:** Good morning. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the socio-ecological model and how it can be applied to understand the complex issue of childhood obesity. The socio-ecological model is a framework that helps us to see how health is influenced by a wide range of factors, not just individual choices. It recognizes that our health is shaped by the social, economic, and physical environments in which we live.

The model is often visualized as a series of concentric circles, with the individual at the center. The first level is the **individual level**, which includes a person's knowledge, attitudes, and **skills**. It also encompasses demographic factors like age, gender, and **socioeconomic** status. The next level is the **interpersonal level**, which focuses on the influence of family, friends, and **peers**. For children, parental modeling of healthy eating and physical activity is a particularly important factor at this level.

Moving outwards, we have the **organizational level**. This includes institutions like schools, workplaces, and **healthcare providers**. School policies on nutrition and physical activity, for example, can have a significant impact on a child's health. The next level is the **community level**, which refers to the broader community context. This includes the availability of parks, playgrounds, and **recreational facilities**. The 'food environment' is also a key aspect of the community level. This refers to the type and density of food outlets in a neighborhood. For example, a high concentration of **fast-food** outlets can make it more difficult for residents to make healthy food choices.

Finally, we have the **public policy level**. This involves local, state, and **national** regulations and laws. Examples of public policies that can influence childhood obesity include taxes on sugary drinks, subsidies for healthy foods, and **regulations** for food advertising, particularly advertising aimed at children.

The great strength of the socio-ecological model is that it highlights the need for a multi-level approach to health promotion. Interventions that target multiple levels of influence are more likely to be **effective** than those that focus on just one level. Addressing a complex problem like childhood obesity requires a **concerted** effort from all sectors of society, from individuals and families to schools, communities, and governments. It truly takes a village to raise a healthy child.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents in the United States between 2017 and 2020, categorized by three distinct age groups: 2-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-19 years.

Overall, the data indicates a clear trend of increasing obesity prevalence with age. The percentage of obese individuals is lowest in the youngest age group and highest among adolescents.

Specifically, for children aged 2 to 5, the obesity rate stood at 12.7%. This figure rose significantly in the next age bracket, with 20.7% of children aged 6 to 11 classified as obese. The highest prevalence was observed among adolescents aged 12 to 19, where 22.2% were considered obese. The difference in prevalence between the youngest and oldest age groups is nearly 10 percentage points, highlighting a substantial increase in obesity as children get older.

In summary, the chart reveals a concerning correlation between age and obesity among young people in the US, with the prevalence of obesity becoming more common as children transition into adolescence.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The escalating crisis of childhood obesity has sparked a contentious debate regarding the locus of responsibility. While some contend that parents are the primary custodians of their children's health and weight, others posit that the government must assume a more interventionist role. This essay will argue that while parental responsibility is paramount, a multi-pronged approach involving significant government intervention is indispensable to effectively curb this epidemic.

On the one hand, the argument for parental responsibility is compelling. Parents are the primary architects of a child's environment and habits. They are the gatekeepers of the food that enters the home and have the most significant influence on a child's dietary patterns and physical activity levels. A home environment where nutritious meals are the norm, and an active lifestyle is encouraged, provides a strong foundation for a healthy life. For instance, parents who cook meals from scratch using fresh ingredients, and who limit their children's consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks, are actively shaping their children's long-term health outcomes. Furthermore, parents who model healthy behaviors, such as engaging in regular physical activity, are more likely to raise children who adopt similar habits. The family unit is, therefore, the first and most crucial line of defense against childhood obesity.

On the other hand, to place the onus of responsibility solely on parents is to ignore the broader societal and environmental factors that contribute to the obesity epidemic. The modern 'obesogenic' environment, characterized by the pervasive marketing of unhealthy foods, the proliferation of fast-food outlets, and the decline of safe public spaces for physical activity, presents a formidable challenge for even the most conscientious of parents. This is where the role of the government becomes critical. Governments have the power to enact policies that can reshape this environment and make healthy choices the easy choices. For example, implementing a tax on sugary beverages, as has been done in several countries, can disincentivize their consumption. Stricter regulations on food advertising aimed at children can protect them from the manipulative tactics of the food industry. Moreover, investing in public infrastructure, such as parks, playgrounds, and cycle lanes, can create more opportunities for children to be physically active.

In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly bear a significant responsibility for their children's health, it is a responsibility that must be shared. The fight against childhood obesity requires a synergistic partnership between families and the state. Parents must be empowered and supported in their efforts to raise healthy children, and this can only be achieved through robust government policies that create a healthier environment for all. Ultimately, a collaborative approach that addresses both individual and societal factors is the only viable path to reversing the alarming trend of childhood obesity.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

The most memorable piece of health-related advice I ever received was from my grandmother. She told me, "You should always eat a rainbow." At first, I was a bit confused, but she explained that she meant I should try to eat fruits and vegetables of different colors every day. She said that each color provides different vitamins and nutrients that are essential for good health.

I was a teenager at the time, and like many teenagers, my diet consisted mainly of pizza, burgers, and other fast food. I wasn't particularly interested in healthy eating, but my grandmother was very persuasive. She started pointing out the colors of the food on my plate and encouraging me to add more variety. She would take me to the local market and show me all the vibrant fruits and vegetables, explaining their benefits in a simple and engaging way.

I decided to give her advice a try. I started by adding a side salad to my meals, and then I began experimenting with different fruits for breakfast. I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the taste of many of the things I had previously avoided. I also noticed that I had more energy and felt better overall. It wasn't a dramatic change overnight, but a gradual process of incorporating more healthy foods into my diet.

I think it was excellent advice because it was simple, memorable, and easy to follow. It wasn't about a restrictive diet or counting calories, but about making positive additions to my meals. It's a piece of advice that has stuck with me, and even now, I try to make my plate as colorful as possible. It's a great reminder to eat a varied and balanced diet.
