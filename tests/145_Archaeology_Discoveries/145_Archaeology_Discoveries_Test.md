**The Top 8 Archaeological Discoveries of 2025 (So Far)**

This year, 8 major archaeological discoveries, from sunken ships to sacred sites, are rewriting history as we know it. From lost royal tombs and underwater time capsules to mythic Greek sanctuaries and vibrant Roman frescoes, 2025 is already shaping up to be a landmark year for archaeology. These top archaeological discoveries span thousands of years and multiple continents.

**1. Valley of the Kings: Thutmose II’s Long-Lost Tomb?**

Early this year, archaeologists working in Egypt’s famed Valley of the Kings announced what may be the burial site of King Thutmose II, who ruled from 1493 to 1479 BCE. The discovery was hailed as the first royal tomb to be found since King Tut—and as the last missing royal tomb of the New Kingdom’s 18th Dynasty. Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, described the royal tomb as “one of the most important archaeological discoveries in recent years,” as it was the first time the funerary furniture of this particular king had been identified.

**2. Dionysian Frescoes Found in Pompeii**

About a century before the ancient Roman city’s destruction, artists adorned the walls of a Pompeii banquet hall with a peculiar procession. Extending across three walls, the frieze depicts followers of Dionysus, the ancient Greek god of wine, fertility, theatre, and religious ecstasy. The discovery reveals rare insights into the Dionysian Mysteries, secretive initiation rites practiced by the Cult of Dionysus in ancient Greece and Rome. The exact details of these rituals were closely guarded and eventually faded into obscurity. Figures in the Pompeii frieze confirm the use of dance, music, and intoxication to induce ecstasy during the Dionysian Mysteries.

**3. Mystery of Sutton Hoo’s Bromeswell Bucket Solved**

A 6th-century Byzantine bucket, known as the “Bromeswell Bucket,” was found at the Anglo-Saxon burial site of Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. The purpose of the bucket had long perplexed historians until a recent discovery confirmed that it had been repurposed as a cremation urn. The remains of a horse and evidence of a funeral pyre at the burial indicate the bucket was used in a high-status cremation ritual. This finding sheds new light on elite burial practices and cultural exchanges in 6th-century England.

**4. Ancient Basilica Beneath the British Capitol**

Archaeologists have discovered that a central London skyscraper is built on the foundations of a vast Roman basilica, dating back to around 78–84 AD. Its discovery reveals the scale and sophistication of urban planning in Londinium. The basilica, one of the largest Roman buildings ever discovered in the UK, likely served as an administrative hub for legal proceedings, commerce, and public gatherings in the capital of Roman Britain. Plans are in place to preserve the site and incorporate it into the building’s basement as a public exhibition.

**5. Sanctuary of Odysseus**

On the Greek island of Ithaca, archaeologists identified what may be an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the legendary Odysseus. Excavations at the archaeological complex, which was already known as the School of Homer, revealed a variety of votive offerings and inscriptions bearing the name “Odysseus.” Additionally, the presence of both Mycenaean and Hellenistic artifacts suggests that worship at the site spanned many centuries. While the Sanctuary of Odysseus may not prove the existence of the Homeric hero, it does demonstrate how the myth shaped reality in ancient Greece.

**6. Roman Frescoes Reborn in London**

In London, experts painstakingly reassembled over 400 fragments of Roman frescoes into a decorative mural featuring birds, lyres, ivy leaves, and a Greek inscription in graffiti. Dating back to the 1st or 2nd century CE, the frescoes once decorated the walls of a Roman townhouse or public building in Londinium. Their vivid colors and refined composition demonstrate expert craftsmanship and the influence of Mediterranean artistic traditions in Roman Britain.

**7. Scotland’s Ancient Giants: Timber Halls Predating Stonehenge**

Beneath a school playground in a Scottish town, archaeologists unearthed traces of a Neolithic hall and its companion building, which date back 6,000 years. The timber hall predates Stonehenge by over a thousand years and is the largest ever found in Scotland. The excavation site yielded ritual pits and a hoard of Bronze Age weapons, including a Celtic gold-inlaid spearhead. Other artifacts, which came from the Highlands and Arran, suggest wide-reaching social organization and ritual activity in prehistoric Britain.

**8. A Sunken Time Capsule in a Roman Shipwreck**

Off the coast of Türkiye’s Antalya province, SCUBA-diving archaeologists uncovered a remarkably intact Roman-era shipwreck. It was submerged about 148 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. The vessel contained hundreds of sealed amphorae that had been perfectly preserved for nearly 2,000 years. These were likely used to transport goods such as wine, olive oil, and tableware. Nicknamed the “Ceramic Wreck,” this top archaeological discovery offers important insights into ancient maritime trade.

**Dig This! 10 Discoveries That Stunned Archaeologists in 2025**

**A**

Once again, it has been a great year for archeology and historical research. Groundbreaking discoveries were made all over the globe, from Egypt’s Valley of the Kings and the ruins of Pompeii to the study halls of Oxford University and the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Some discoveries were made possible by advancements in technologies like artificial intelligence (A.I.) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), others by human initiative and creativity. As always, luck played a role as well: one researcher stumbled upon a breakthrough while going out for a walk.

**B**

Archaeologists from the New Kingdom Research Foundation discovered the tomb of Thutmose II, a pharaoh of ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty. Located near the Valley of the Kings, west of Luxor, it was the first royal tomb to be discovered since Tutankhamen’s in 1922. It was also mostly empty and in poor condition; archaeologists suspect its contents were moved to a different location on account of floods that occurred shortly after the pharaoh’s passing. What remains suggests Thutmose’s wife and half-sister, Queen Hatshepsut, was responsible for the burial.

**C**

A lecturer and scholar at Oxford University specializing in early modern literature uncovered a special copy of William Shakespeare’s Sonnet 116 while browsing handwritten manuscripts at Oxford’s Bodleian Library. The find is unique since this copy appears to have been revised, with additional lines added and changes made to the sonnet’s first and last couplets. Long regarded as a treatise on love, the revisions reveal a hitherto hidden subtext related to the politics of the English Civil War.

**D**

Archaeologists in Pompeii found two life-sized sculptures of a man and woman at the necropolis of Porta Sarno, a burial ground whose oldest known internments date back to the 4th century B.C.E. The statues, created between 133 and 31 B.C.E., are thought to depict a husband and wife. The female figure wears a necklace with a crescent moon pendant—an ornament believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits. This and other items indicate she may have been a priestess, a prestigious position in Rome’s patriarchal society.

**E**

For several years, a duo of remote-operated submarines named Romeo and Juliet hovered over the North Atlantic ocean floor to create a 3D scan of the Titanic—or what’s left of it. The now-completed project, which captures everything from the luxury cruiser’s dislocated stern to the personal belongings of its ill-fated passengers, answers longstanding questions about the incident. One of these concerns first officer William McMaster Murdoch. For over a century, the prevailing rumor was that Murdoch abandoned his post, saving himself at the expense of others. Scans of the mechanism used to lower the ship’s lifeboats onto the water tell a different story, indicating Murdoch carried out his duties until the cold, bitter end.

**F**

Ever since it was discovered in 1901 by a group of divers off the coast of a Greek island, researchers have wondered what the Antikythera mechanism was used for. Currently, the prevailing theory is that the mechanism—a clocklike conglomeration of gears and dials—was an ancient supercomputer used to track the movement of celestial objects. If this is true, it wasn’t very good at its job. After testing a digital reconstruction, researchers at the National University of Mar del Plata in Argentina found that the Antikythera mechanism contains several design flaws that would have made the contraption—which jammed in 90 percent of simulations—borderline unusable.

**G**

During one of his daily pandemic walks past the 70-foot-tall obelisk of Ramses II at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, Egyptologist and Sorbonne University lecturer Jean-Guillaume Olette-Pelletier noticed something no other Parisian had noticed before. After receiving permission to climb the monument, he confirmed that the topmost hieroglyphs read out a propagandistic reminder that Ramses had been chosen by the gods to rule over Egypt. The hieroglyphs, difficult to see from street level, would have been clearly visible from its original location near the Temple of Luxor, where nobles arrived by boat to attend the yearly Opet festival.

**H**

In 2018, researchers from the University of Baghdad and Munich’s Ludwig Maximilian University set out to digitize every cuneiform tablet ever discovered. This year, with the help of A.I., they have uncovered a 250-line hymn celebrating the glory of Babylon and its citizens. The hymn, originally created around 1,000 B.C.E., showed up in more than 30 manuscripts—a search result that would have taken humans decades to produce were it not for machine-learning tools. The quantity and chronological distribution of the texts, ranging between the 7th and 1st century B.C.E., suggest the hymn played an important, institutionalized role in Babylonia, functioning as a kind of Mesopotamian equivalent to the Pledge of Allegiance.

**The most incredible ancient discoveries made recently**

You might think, given the intervening millennia, that we would already have found most of the world's ancient treasures, but new artefacts and monuments are still being unearthed every year. From Iron Age hoards and rare biblical inscriptions to lost desert cities and even the skeletons of huge sea dragons, the past few years have shed dazzling new light on the distant past.

**Roman coin hoard, Wales, UK**

In October 2025, metal detectorist David Moss and his friend Ian Nicholson discovered two clay pots in north Wales thought to contain up to 15,000 Roman coins. Fearing they could be stolen Moss slept with the hoard in his car for three days before taking it to experts. The coins are now at the National Museum Cardiff where they will be analysed. The largest hoard the museum is aware of to date contained 10,000 coins, so this find could turn out to be the biggest hoard ever discovered in Wales.

**The ancient city of Peñico, Peru**

In July 2025, the 3,800-year-old city of Peñico was unveiled by the Peruvian archaeologist Dr Ruth Shady. Situated in the Supe Valley, the site contains 18 structures including ceremonial temples and residential compounds that were once home to members of the ancient Caral civilisation, who inhabited Peru long before the Aztecs, Maya or Inca. Shady’s investigations into the Caral, which began in 1994, have revealed them to be one of the ancient world’s most peaceful societies. No defensive walls or weapons have been discovered and it seems their society was built on trade, music, ritual and consensus.

**'Missing pharaoh', Valley of the Kings, Egypt**

In February 2025, a joint British/Egyptian team discovered a rock-hewn tomb in the western wadis near the Valley of the Kings that was immediately hailed as the most significant discovery since Tutankhamun in 1922. It belonged to Thutmose II, known as the ‘missing pharaoh’, who ruled Egypt from 1493 to 1479 BC. It was empty, with indications that Thutmose II and his treasures were moved just six years after the burial when the tomb flooded. But the team are hoping to find a second, intact tomb soon.

**UK's biggest ever dinosaur footprint site, England, UK**

At the start of 2025, it was reported that the UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site had been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire. Consisting of roughly 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, the site shows the movements of a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and a smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus. The tracks were first spotted in 2024 by a worker operating a digger at Dewars Farm Quarry. A team of over 100 scientists, students and volunteers took part in the excavation, which features on a new series of the BBC's Digging for Britain.

**Roman villa complex, England, UK**

In March 2024, archaeologists from the Red River Archaeology Group uncovered a remarkable Roman villa complex while working on a housing development in the English county of Oxfordshire. The buildings were once vibrantly decorated with mosaics and painted plaster, while uncovered artefacts include miniature votive axes, a horse-head buckle and jewellery. The team also found evidence of a hypocaust – an ancient system of underfloor heating – as well as T-shaped ovens (pictured) used for drying cereal and hops.

**New frescoes, Pompeii, Italy**

Among the most intensively excavated archaeological sites in the world, the ancient Roman city of Pompeii – preserved under a layer of volcanic ash following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 – turns up dazzling new discoveries almost every year. In 2024, this astonishing archaeological conveyor belt served up a splendid banqueting room, decorated with frescoes depicting mythological characters and figures from the Trojan War. Various heroes adorn the walls of the elegant entertaining space, including Helen, Paris and Cassandra, daughter of Priam. The walls were painted black to stop smoke from the oil lamps leaving a mark.

**Burned Neolithic porridge, Germany**

If you've ever burned your porridge on a sleepy Monday morning, don't worry – you're slotting into a 5,000-year-old tradition. The remains of a charred cooking pot uncovered in Germany in January 2024 revealed what might be the world's first recorded attempt at cooking the breakfast staple – and it didn't go well. The shards were found in a rubbish heap at the Neolithic settlement Oldenburg LA 7, thought to be one of the oldest villages in Germany, and residues showed a failed effort to cook mixed cereal grains with seeds in water – a rare insight into the diets and routines of our Stone Age forebears.

**Roman funerary bed, London, England, UK**

Excavations in central London in early 2024 uncovered five extremely rare Roman oak-wood coffins and what might be the first complete Roman funerary bed ever found in Britain. Twenty feet (6m) below London's streets and preserved by the damp mud of the River Fleet, the almost-2,000-year-old bed matches depictions of funerary beds found in Roman art, with carved feet and joints fixed with wooden pegs. As for the coffins, only three well-preserved Roman-era timber coffins have been unearthed before.

**Roman mausoleum, London, England, UK**

An ancient Roman mausoleum described by experts as "completely unique" was unearthed in central London in June 2023, just a stone's throw from the city's biggest skyscraper, the Shard. Hot on the heels of another set of elaborate mosaics found at the site in 2022, the discovery included walls, interior flooring and a beautiful central mosaic featuring a flower surrounded by concentric circles and red tiles – a typically Roman design. Excavators called it "the most intact Roman mausoleum ever to be discovered in Britain".

**Sculpture of K'awiil, Mexico**

The Maya Train Project is a high-speed rail network that connects archaeological sites along Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. During its construction, a huge haul of artefacts were unearthed along the line. This extraordinary sculpture of K'awiil, the Maya god of lightning, power, fertility and strength, was uncovered in May 2023. Archaeologists were thrilled with the figure, which would once have adorned the lid of a stone urn, as it's only the fourth three-dimensional depiction of K'awiil ever discovered. It's also the first found outside the ancient Maya capital of Tikal in modern-day Guatemala.

**Tartessos faces, Merida, Spain**

Five life-sized busts discovered near Merida in Spain in May 2023 are thought to be the only known depictions of the Tartessos people – an ancient civilisation that vanished more than 2,500 years ago. The faces were found in a sealed pit mixed with sacrificial animal bones near the ancient Tartessian temple of Casas del Turunuelo, and date from the 5th century BC (near the end of the Tartessian era). Two of the reliefs are almost complete and probably represent female deities – significant as the Tartessians were thought to portray gods as animals and plants. Based in southern Spain, the Tartessos people were once linked by Greek philosopher Aristotle with the mythical lost city of Atlantis.
