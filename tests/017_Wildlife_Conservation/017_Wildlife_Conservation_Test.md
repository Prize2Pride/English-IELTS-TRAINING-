### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**Reading Passage 1**

The world is home to an amazing diversity of species – each with its own unique contribution to make to our planet. Unfortunately, many of these species are increasingly under threat due to human activities. In order to save vulnerable wildlife populations, it is crucial that we all take action to protect their habitats, and reduce the risks facing them. This article will take a closer look at the challenges of wildlife conservation and explore some of the ways we can help ensure that the future of our planet’s species is secure.

One of the biggest threats to biodiversity is the growing impact of human activity. This includes industrial development, land use changes, pollution, deforestation and other destructive practices. All of these activities can have a devastating effect on wildlife populations, threatening the habitats and resources they need to survive. To combat this problem, it is essential that governments and organisations work together to develop effective environmental policies that minimise the destructive effects of human activity on nature.

In addition to policy development, it is also important to raise awareness and educate people on the importance of protecting wildlife. This can be done through campaigns, public events, and educational programs. By increasing public understanding, we can create a more informed and engaged population that is better equipped to make decisions that protect the environment and its inhabitants.

Climate change is one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity, with many species already facing serious risks due to rising temperatures and other climatic changes. From shifting precipitation patterns to extending fire seasons, climate change is affecting ecosystems in profound ways – and wildlife populations are particularly vulnerable. In order to mitigate the impact of global warming, scientists and politicians must work together to reduce our emissions and halt the march of climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, conservationists are also working to protect wildlife habitats from the effects of climate change. This includes restoring wetlands, planting trees, and creating corridors that allow species to migrate to more suitable habitats. By protecting and restoring habitats, we can help wildlife populations adapt to the changing climate and ensure their survival for generations to come.

In addition to policy actions, local communities play an important role in wildlife conservation. By engaging with local communities and understanding their needs, conservationists can find ways to integrate sustainable activities with wildlife conservations goals. For example, working with local communities to create ecotourism opportunities or education programs can help foster relationships between people and nature. It’s essential that conservationists develop effective strategies for working with local communities if wildlife populations are to be successfully protected in the future.

Wildlife conservation isn’t just good for biodiversity; it also offers economic benefits. Protected natural areas can attract more tourists, providing additional income for local communities. Moreover, preserving intact ecosystems helps alleviate famine by ensuring that agricultural practices are sustainable and efficient. Protecting wildlife can also lead to critical breakthroughs in medical research due to the many valuable compounds found in plants and animals.

Habitat destruction is one of the biggest threats to global biodiversity. When natural habitats are destroyed for industrial purposes or intensive agriculture, sensitive species can become isolated and unable to find new sources of food or shelter. To preserve biodiversity, it is important that governments work with companies and landowners to reduce destruction of critical habitats. This could involve policies such as creating protected natural areas or developing “green” technologies that minimise destruction.

Technology continues to offer increasingly innovative solutions for protecting vulnerable species and habitats in our world. From using drones to monitor poaching or illegal fishing activity, to using predictive tracking software that warns about potential threats in advance, technology can provide powerful tools for protecting biodiversity. However, it is important that these solutions are used responsibly. It is also important that technology solutions are tailored for local conditions as this will help boost sustainability and ensure greater success when deployed in different contexts.

**Reading Passage 2**

**A. The Brink of Extinction and Back**

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the countless stories of wildlife species declining or balancing precariously at the brink of extinction. Amidst these disheartening stories, it’s important to remember that we have the power to reverse wildlife declines and bring species back from near extinction. Through collaborative partnerships, bold efforts, and decisive investments, conservationists have recovered wildlife species that have suffered dramatic declines and even brought back species that had gone extinct in the wild. These success stories serve as hopeful reminders that when we invest in wildlife conservation, wildlife wins.

**B. The Bald Eagle's Revival**

Long a symbol of American national pride, the bald eagle came to the brink of extinction throughout much of its range in the 1960s. Following a long-term decline coinciding with a reduction in its prey species, the introduction of the egg-thinning pesticide DDT nearly wiped out bald eagles from the lower 48 states. In 1962, Rachel Carson’s landmark conservation science book, *Silent Spring*, brought to light the detrimental effects of DDT on birds and the environment, and under mounting pressure, the EPA largely banned the use of DDT in 1972. The bald eagle landed on the original endangered species list in 1967, gaining important protections from hunting and loss of habitat. The ban on DDT, protections from the Endangered Species Act, and captive breeding and reintroduction efforts all helped reverse the bald eagle’s decline. In 2007, the Interior Department officially declared the bald eagle fully recovered and removed it from the endangered species list. As of 2021, the bald eagle population climbed to an estimated 316,700 individuals.

**C. The California Condor's Close Call**

North America’s largest land bird also claims one of the continent’s most incredible conservation success stories. Poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction nearly drove the California condor to extinction by the late 20th century. In 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made the bold, but risky decision to capture all remaining California condors in the wild, which by that time numbered only 27. With every existing California condor now in captivity, efforts focused on breeding the birds at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and the Los Angeles Zoo. Breeding efforts were successful, and in 1991, the condor recovery program began to release the birds back into the wild. Since then, the wild population has grown, and as of 2018 there were an estimated 537 California condors living in the wild or in captivity.

**D. A Tiny Fish's Triumph**

There is only a single population in the world of the tiny fish known as the Foskett speckled dace, and it was historically confined to just one spring in Oregon. Livestock use of its habitat, modification of its home spring, and groundwater pumping resulting in a lower water table all threatened the dace, which was already at a higher risk of extinction due to its extremely limited range. These factors sent the Foskett speckled dace to the endangered species list in 1985. To help ensure the survival of the species by creating a refuge population, wildlife officials translocated a number of Foskett speckled dace to an additional spring close to the fish’s native spring. In 1987, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) acquired the land around both of these springs and constructed fences around them to keep out cattle that were damaging the habitat. With its habitat expanded and restored and a plan in place to continue to protect it, the Foskett speckled dace is no longer threatened with extinction, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed it from the endangered species list in September of 2019.

**E. The Karner Blue Butterfly's Comeback**

The Karner blue butterfly once flourished in the oak savannas and pine barrens of a continuous geographic band stretching from Minnesota east to the Atlantic seaboard. Unfortunately, populations declined dramatically in the 20th century because of habitat loss and fire suppression, which has limited the growth of wild blue lupine—a fire-dependent plant that serves as the only host for Karner blue caterpillars. With its range having diminished to only limited portions of New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, and Minnesota, the Karner blue butterfly was listed as Endangered in 1992. Since then, bold conservation efforts including reintroductions in New Hampshire, Ohio, and Indiana, prescribed burning to restore wild blue lupine, and conservation agreements with private landowners, have helped recover the butterfly.

**F. A Warbler's Return**

Due to its dependence on a highly specific habitat type—large stands of young, dense jack pine forest disturbed by wildfire—the Kirtland’s warbler has one of the most restricted breeding ranges of any bird in the continental United States. Historic fire suppression has limited the growth of new jack pine forest, leading to a dearth of habitat for the warbler. Another threat has come from the parasitic brown-headed cowbird, which lays its eggs in the nests of other birds and has made it difficult for Kirtland’s warblers to raise their young successfully. These threats caused a huge decline in Kirtland’s warblers and led the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to list the species as endangered in 1967. Conservationists launched an aggressive cowbird removal effort in 1972 that continues to this day and has led to major improvements in nesting success. With a better understanding of the warbler’s habitat needs, land managers are successfully maintaining suitable habitat by clearing forest and planting young jack pine seedlings every year. The Kirtland’s warbler population is now estimated to be over 2,000 pairs and continues to grow. Having reached more than double the recovery goal, the Kirtland’s warbler was removed from the endangered species list in 2019.

**Reading Passage 3**

Technology permeates every facet of our daily lives, and its effects are felt by virtually everyone on the planet. Technological innovation has the potential to transform how we tackle today’s – and tomorrow’s – biggest conservation challenges. As the pace of changes driven by technology continues to accelerate, it’s vital that we channel these developments into positive outcomes for nature. Fauna & Flora and our partners use a wide range of tech tools – from familiar favourites to the latest innovations – to maximise our conservation impact.

Remote camera traps have made a huge contribution to the discovery of new, rare, secretive and elusive species. They also provide a non-intrusive means of monitoring species’ behaviour, distribution and diversity within a landscape, and help protect threatened wildlife and habitats from poaching and other illegal activities. BRUVs (short for baited remote underwater videos) are a marine form of camera-trapping that provide a low-budget way to monitor species diversity, abundance and behaviour beneath the waves.

Geographic information systems (GIS) are computer-based tools used to store, visualise, analyse and interpret geographic data. GIS mapping technology plays a crucial role in making informed decisions about wildlife protection and habitat management. Remote sensing – capturing high-resolution images of an area from a distance – enables conservationists to accurately observe wildlife populations, to monitor illegal mining, to quickly identify causes of deforestation, and to detect and analyse other changes to the landscape.

Pioneering conservationists use environmental DNA (eDNA) to collect a wealth of biodata quickly and easily from soil and water samples. Traces of animal DNA can reveal the presence of previously unobserved species. A few small samples may contain the DNA of dozens of species, providing a swift but detailed snapshot of an ecosystem. The data can then be used to make the case for greater protection of an area.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly called drones, are used to pick up signals from tracking gear on the ground, collect images of wildlife and habitats from the air, or gather acoustic data with specialised hydrophones, for example. They can collect high-resolution data quickly, non-invasively and relatively cheaply. Thermal drones, which detect heat sources and convert the data into digital imagery, are particularly useful for wildlife surveys because they make the invisible visible.

Biologging is the catch-all term for attaching electronic tags to individual animals to record and relay data about their movements, behaviour and surroundings. Real-time tracking helps with management, security and research. It can also help shed light on trafficking routes and the global movements of wildlife, timber and other illegal traded products. Tracking collars, which are often fitted to endangered megafauna such as lions and elephants, help to protect them from a variety of threats including human-wildlife conflict.

Computer vision systems use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to mimic the capabilities of the human brain that are responsible for object recognition and object classification. Harnessing computer power rather than using human labour to analyse thousands of images and other datasets allows us to speed up species identification, monitor wildlife in real time and predict when and where endangered species are most at risk.

Despite the great potential of technology, conservationists hoping to harness its power are faced with a number of challenges and constraints. These include: upfront and maintenance costs; shortage of tech skills among users; limited capacity and access to training; competition for funding; duplication of effort; and the scalability and sustainability of tech solutions. To realise the full potential of technology in conservation, we need collaboration, not competition. Open, accessible solutions that are fit for purpose, not one-size-fits-all. Global data sharing and local capacity building. More user-friendly technologies. And translation of tech insights into conservation action on the ground.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Blackwood Wildlife Sanctuary. My name is David, and I'll be your guide for today's tour. The sanctuary was founded in 1995 by a group of local conservationists who were concerned about the decline of native wildlife in the area. Over the years, we've grown into a thriving conservation center, and we're now home to over 150 species of birds, as well as a wide variety of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

Our main attraction is the primate rehabilitation center, where we care for orphaned and injured monkeys and apes. We have a dedicated team of vets and animal care specialists who work around the clock to ensure the well-being of our residents. We're currently raising funds for a new veterinary hospital, which will allow us to provide even better care for our animals.

As we walk through the sanctuary, please remember to stay on the designated paths and not to feed the animals. We also advise you to wear comfortable shoes, as there will be a lot of walking involved. And please, no flash photography, as it can startle the animals.

Now, let's take a look at the map of the sanctuary. We are currently at the entrance. To our left is the Education Center, where you can watch a short film about the history of the sanctuary. Straight ahead is the Otter Pool, where you can watch our playful otters during their feeding session at 11 am. To the right, you'll find the Lookout Point, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside. From there, you can take a guided walk through the ancient woodland. The Gift Shop is located next to the cafe, where you can buy souvenirs to remember your visit. And finally, at the far end of the sanctuary, we have the Lake, where you can take a relaxing boat trip.

We also offer a range of workshops throughout the year, so be sure to check our website for more details. We hope you enjoy your visit to the Blackwood Wildlife Sanctuary.

**SECTION 3**

**(D = David, M = Maria)**

**D:** So, for our presentation, we're discussing the role of zoos in conservation. I have to say, I'm not a big fan of zoos. I think it's cruel to keep animals in captivity.

**M:** I can see your point, David, but I think modern zoos are very different from the zoos of the past. They play a vital role in protecting endangered species.

**D:** I'm not so sure. I've seen documentaries about animals in zoos suffering from stress and boredom. The enclosures are often too small, and they don't have enough mental stimulation.

**M:** I agree that some zoos are not up to standard, but the good ones are accredited and have to meet strict welfare standards. They focus on providing a naturalistic environment for the animals, with plenty of enrichment activities.

**D:** But is it really natural? I mean, they're still in a cage.

**M:** It's not ideal, but for many species, it's their only chance of survival. Many zoos are involved in captive breeding programs for endangered species, with the ultimate goal of reintroducing them into the wild.

**D:** I'm skeptical about the success of reintroduction programs. It's not as simple as just releasing animals back into their natural habitat. They need to be able to find food, avoid predators, and integrate with the wild population.

**M:** It's a complex process, but there have been some amazing success stories. The Golden Lion Tamarin, for example, was on the brink of extinction, but thanks to a captive breeding and reintroduction program, its population is now stable.

**D:** I guess that's a fair point. So, what do you think is the most important role of modern zoos?

**M:** I think it's a combination of conservation, research, and education. Zoos have a unique opportunity to educate the public about the importance of wildlife conservation and to inspire them to take action.

**D:** I agree with that. I think education is key. So, for our presentation, we could discuss the pros and cons of zoos, and then focus on the role of modern zoos in conservation, with some case studies of successful breeding and reintroduction programs.

**M:** That sounds like a good plan. We could also look at the challenges that zoos face, such as funding and public perception.

**D:** And we should definitely visit a local zoo to see for ourselves what they're doing.

**M:** Great idea. Let's research a specific zoo's conservation program to use as a case study.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning. Today, I'm going to be talking about the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine wildlife. As you may know, over 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans every year. This plastic comes from a variety of sources, including landfill sites, littering, and industrial waste. And it has a devastating impact on marine ecosystems.

There are two main types of plastic pollution: macroplastics and microplastics. Macroplastics are large plastic items such as bottles, bags, and fishing nets. Microplastics are small plastic particles less than 5mm in size. They can be primary microplastics, such as the microbeads found in some cosmetics, or secondary microplastics, which are formed from the breakdown of larger plastic items.

Both macroplastics and microplastics pose a serious threat to marine wildlife. One of the biggest problems is ingestion. Animals often mistake plastic for food. This can lead to internal injuries, starvation, and even death. It affects a wide range of species, from the smallest plankton to the largest whales.

Another major problem is entanglement. Animals can become trapped in plastic debris, such as fishing nets and six-pack rings. This can cause drowning, suffocation, and serious injuries. Sea turtles, seals, and seabirds are particularly vulnerable to entanglement.

In addition to the physical dangers, plastics can also be toxic. They can contain harmful chemicals, such as BPA and phthalates. These chemicals can leach into the water and be absorbed by marine organisms. This can cause a range of health problems, including reproductive issues.

To illustrate the scale of the problem, let's take a look at the case of the albatross on Midway Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. This remote island is thousands of miles from the nearest continent, yet its beaches are littered with plastic. The adult albatrosses mistake the plastic for food and feed it to their chicks. As a result, many of the chicks die from starvation or ruptured organs.

So, what can we do to solve this problem? The most important thing is to reduce our consumption of plastic. We can do this by choosing reusable alternatives to single-use plastics, such as water bottles, coffee cups, and shopping bags. We also need to make sure that we dispose of our plastic waste responsibly, by recycling as much as possible. We can also support beach and ocean clean-up initiatives. And we need to invest in research to develop new technologies and materials to replace plastic.

In conclusion, plastic pollution is a global threat to marine wildlife. It requires urgent action from individuals, governments, and industries. We all have a role to play in protecting our oceans for future generations.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The bar chart illustrates the estimated population of the mountain gorilla in three distinct regions—Region A, Region B, and Region C—for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020.

Overall, the total population of mountain gorillas across the three regions shows a significant increase over the 20-year period. While Region A experienced a dramatic decline in its gorilla population, both Region B and Region C saw substantial growth, with Region B becoming the most populous area by 2020.

In 2000, Region A had the largest population, with 1200 gorillas. However, this number plummeted to 800 in 2010 and continued to fall to just 400 by 2020, representing a two-thirds reduction over two decades. In stark contrast, Region B began with a modest population of 600 gorillas in 2000, which then grew to 900 in 2010. This upward trend accelerated, and by 2020, the population had more than doubled from its initial number to 1500, making it the region with the highest gorilla population.

Region C also demonstrated consistent growth, albeit on a smaller scale. Starting with the lowest population of 300 gorillas in 2000, it increased to 450 in 2010 and reached 600 by 2020, effectively doubling its population over the 20-year span.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The protection of endangered species is a critical issue in the modern world, and there are differing views on the most effective conservation strategies. Some advocate for the creation of protected areas such as national parks, while others contend that addressing the root causes of endangerment, like poaching and habitat loss, through education and policy is more crucial. This essay will discuss both perspectives before offering my own opinion.

On the one hand, establishing protected areas is a cornerstone of wildlife conservation. These designated zones provide a sanctuary where animals can live and breed without the immediate threat of human encroachment and industrial development. National parks and reserves, for instance, often have dedicated ranger patrols that actively deter poachers and monitor the health of the animal populations. The Serengeti in Tanzania is a prime example, where the vast protected landscape allows for the great wildebeest migration, a phenomenon that would be impossible without such a large, secure area. By safeguarding entire ecosystems, these reserves not only protect the target species but also the myriad of other plants and animals that constitute a balanced environment. This holistic approach is vital for long-term biodiversity.

On the other hand, simply cordoning off areas of land does not address the external pressures that drive species to the brink of extinction. Proponents of a more proactive approach argue that we must tackle the socio-economic factors that lead to poaching and habitat destruction. Education plays a pivotal role in this; when local communities understand the long-term economic and ecological benefits of conservation, they are more likely to become partners in protection rather than adversaries. Furthermore, robust government policies and international agreements are essential to combat the illegal wildlife trade, which is often a sophisticated, transnational crime. For example, the global ban on ivory trade, though not perfectly enforced, has been instrumental in slowing the decline of elephant populations. Without addressing these fundamental issues, protected areas remain vulnerable islands in a sea of external threats.

In my view, a combination of both approaches is not only ideal but essential for effective wildlife conservation. Protected areas provide the immediate, critical safe havens that endangered species need to survive in the short term. However, these sanctuaries cannot exist in a vacuum. They must be supported by a broader strategy that includes comprehensive education programs to foster a culture of conservation, and strong, enforced policies to eradicate the illegal activities that threaten wildlife. The most successful conservation stories, such as the recovery of the mountain gorilla, have involved a multi-faceted approach that combines habitat protection with community engagement and governmental cooperation. Therefore, a truly effective strategy is one that integrates the creation of protected zones with a determined effort to resolve the underlying causes of endangerment.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

I’d like to talk about a time I saw a truly magnificent wild animal, which was a sea turtle. This happened a few years ago when I was on holiday with my family in a small coastal town in Malaysia. We had heard from the locals that there was a particular beach where green sea turtles would come ashore at night to lay their eggs, so we decided to go and see if we were lucky enough to witness it.

We went to the beach late one evening and sat quietly in the dark, just listening to the sound of the waves. After about an hour of waiting, we saw a dark shape slowly emerging from the sea. It was a huge female green turtle, probably about a metre long. She moved so slowly and deliberately, dragging her heavy body up the sandy beach. It was clear she was on a mission.

She found a spot high up on the beach and began to dig a nest with her flippers, sending sand flying everywhere. It was an incredible sight to see this ancient creature, driven by instinct, preparing to lay her eggs. We kept our distance and stayed very quiet so as not to disturb her. After she had laid her eggs and covered the nest, she made her slow journey back to the sea and disappeared into the waves. The whole experience was just magical and very moving.

I found it so interesting because it felt like I was witnessing a secret and ancient ritual. It was a powerful reminder of the beauty and resilience of nature. Seeing the turtle up close and understanding the challenges she faced just to lay her eggs made me appreciate the importance of protecting these amazing creatures and their habitats. It’s a memory that has definitely stayed with me and has made me much more passionate about marine conservation.
