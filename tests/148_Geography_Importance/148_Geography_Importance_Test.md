You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Enduring Importance of Geography**

Geography, a discipline often relegated to the dusty corners of the mind as a mere exercise in memorizing capitals and coastlines, is, in reality, a vibrant and essential lens through which to understand our world. It is the science of place and space, a holistic field that bridges the social and natural sciences to examine the intricate tapestry of our planet. In an era of unprecedented globalization, environmental change, and geopolitical complexity, the importance of a geographical perspective has never been more acute.

At its core, geography seeks to answer the question of "why here?". It explores the relationships between people, places, and environments, and how these interactions shape our societies, cultures, and economies. This understanding is fundamental to navigating the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. From the intricate dance of global supply chains to the devastating impacts of climate change, a geographical lens provides the tools to comprehend and respond to the world around us.

One of the most significant contributions of geography is its ability to foster a deep appreciation for the planet. By studying the Earth's physical systems – its landforms, oceans, atmosphere, and ecosystems – we gain a profound understanding of the delicate balance that sustains life. This knowledge is not merely academic; it is a call to action. As we witness the accelerating pace of environmental degradation, from deforestation in the Amazon to the melting of polar ice caps, a geographical understanding empowers us to become more responsible stewards of our planet. It provides the foundation for informed decision-making, enabling us to advocate for sustainable practices and policies that will protect our world for future generations.

Furthermore, geography is a powerful tool for cultivating cultural understanding and empathy. In a world that is increasingly interconnected, the ability to appreciate and respect diverse cultures is paramount. Human geography delves into the rich tapestry of human societies, exploring their beliefs, customs, languages, and traditions. By examining how different cultures interact with their environments, we can begin to understand the complex forces that have shaped their unique identities. This understanding is a vital antidote to the prejudice and intolerance that so often fuel conflict and division. It allows us to see the world through the eyes of others, to recognize our shared humanity, and to build bridges of understanding across cultural divides.

In addition to its broader societal benefits, the study of geography also equips individuals with a range of practical and transferable skills. The discipline's emphasis on data analysis, critical thinking, and problem-solving is highly valued in a wide array of professions. Geographers are trained to collect, analyze, and interpret spatial data, a skill that is increasingly in demand in fields such as urban planning, environmental management, and market research. They are also adept at synthesizing information from a variety of sources, evaluating different perspectives, and communicating their findings in a clear and concise manner. These skills are not only valuable in the workplace; they are essential for navigating the complexities of modern life.

In conclusion, geography is far more than a collection of facts and figures. It is a dynamic and essential discipline that provides a unique and powerful framework for understanding our world. By fostering a deeper appreciation for the planet, cultivating cultural understanding, and equipping individuals with a range of practical skills, geography empowers us to become more informed, engaged, and responsible global citizens. In an age of unprecedented change and uncertainty, the enduring importance of geography cannot be overstated.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**Geography in a Globalised World**

**A**
In the hyper-connected world of the 21st century, it is easy to assume that geography has become irrelevant. With the advent of the internet, instant communication, and high-speed travel, it may seem that the constraints of distance and location have been all but erased. However, to dismiss the importance of geography in a globalised world would be a grave mistake. In fact, the very forces of globalisation that appear to diminish the significance of place are, in many ways, making it more important than ever. A nuanced understanding of geography is crucial for navigating the complexities of our interconnected world, from the intricacies of global trade to the challenges of sustainable development.

**B**
Globalisation, in its essence, is a geographical phenomenon. It refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information. This process is not uniform; it creates a complex and uneven landscape of winners and losers, opportunities and challenges. A geographical perspective allows us to analyse these patterns, to understand why some regions thrive in the global economy while others are left behind. It helps us to see how the flows of capital, goods, and information are shaped by physical and human geography, from the location of natural resources to the presence of skilled labour.

**C**
One of the most profound impacts of globalisation has been the rise of global supply chains. The products we consume daily, from our smartphones to our clothing, are often the result of a complex network of production and distribution that spans multiple countries and continents. Geography is central to understanding how these supply chains function. It helps us to identify the most efficient routes for transporting goods, to assess the risks posed by natural disasters or political instability, and to understand the social and environmental impacts of production in different parts of the world. As companies seek to optimise their supply chains and minimise their costs, a sophisticated understanding of geography is not just an academic exercise; it is a business imperative.

**D**
Technology, another key driver of globalisation, has also had a paradoxical effect on the importance of geography. While the internet allows for instant communication and the seamless transfer of information across borders, it has not created a 'flat' world in which location is irrelevant. On the contrary, it has led to the clustering of economic activity in specific places. Silicon Valley, for example, remains the epicentre of the global tech industry, despite the fact that software can be written anywhere in the world. This is because innovation is not just about technology; it is about people. It thrives in environments where there is a critical mass of talent, a supportive ecosystem of universities and venture capitalists, and a culture of collaboration and risk-taking. These are all geographical factors that cannot be easily replicated.

**E**
Furthermore, as the world becomes more interconnected, it is also becoming more aware of the shared challenges we face, from climate change to pandemics. These are global problems that require global solutions, but they also have distinct geographical dimensions. Climate change, for example, will have a disproportionate impact on low-lying coastal areas and arid regions. Pandemics can spread rapidly through global travel networks, but their impact is often shaped by local factors such as population density and the quality of healthcare infrastructure. A geographical perspective is essential for understanding the complex interplay of global and local factors that shape these challenges, and for developing effective and equitable solutions.

**F**
In conclusion, while the forces of globalisation and technology may have altered our perception of distance and location, they have not diminished the importance of geography. On the contrary, they have made it more critical than ever. A geographical perspective is essential for understanding the complexities of our interconnected world, for navigating the challenges and opportunities of globalisation, and for building a more sustainable and equitable future. In the 21st century, geography is not just about knowing where places are; it is about understanding why they matter.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Power of Geographical Literacy**

In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the need for geographical literacy has never been more pressing. Geographical literacy is more than just the ability to read a map or locate countries on a globe; it is the capacity to reason with geographic information to make informed decisions. It is a fundamental skill that empowers individuals to understand the world around them, to appreciate the interconnectedness of global issues, and to participate as active and responsible citizens. Despite its importance, however, geographical literacy is on the decline in many parts of the world, a trend that has serious implications for our collective future.

A geographically literate individual is able to understand the complex interplay of physical and human systems that shape our world. They can analyze how the distribution of resources, the patterns of climate, and the movement of people and goods influence everything from local economies to global politics. This understanding is essential for making sense of the news, for evaluating the claims of politicians and advertisers, and for making informed decisions about a wide range of issues, from where to live and work to how to vote.

The decline in geographical literacy can be attributed to a number of factors. In many schools, geography has been marginalized, squeezed out of the curriculum by a focus on subjects that are perceived to be more economically valuable, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The rise of GPS and other navigation technologies has also contributed to a sense of complacency, with many people believing that they no longer need to have a mental map of the world. However, this reliance on technology can be a double-edged sword. While it is undoubtedly convenient, it can also lead to a decline in our spatial awareness and our ability to think critically about the world around us.

The consequences of this decline in geographical literacy are far-reaching. A lack of geographical knowledge can lead to a poor understanding of global issues, from climate change to international trade. It can also contribute to a sense of isolation and a lack of empathy for people from other cultures and backgrounds. In a world that is increasingly defined by global challenges, a lack of geographical literacy is not just a personal failing; it is a threat to our collective well-being.

Fortunately, there are a number of initiatives underway to promote geographical literacy. Organizations such as the National Geographic Society are working to raise awareness of the importance of geography and to provide resources for teachers and students. They are also advocating for the inclusion of geography in the school curriculum, and for the development of new and innovative ways of teaching the subject. These efforts are essential if we are to reverse the decline in geographical literacy and to ensure that future generations have the knowledge and skills they need to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.

In addition to these formal education initiatives, there are also many things that individuals can do to improve their own geographical literacy. Reading books and articles about different parts of the world, traveling to new places, and paying attention to the geographical context of news stories are all great ways to expand our understanding of the world. In an age of information overload, it is more important than ever to be able to think critically about the information we consume, and to have a solid foundation of geographical knowledge to help us make sense of it all.

In conclusion, geographical literacy is not a trivial pursuit; it is a fundamental skill that is essential for navigating the complexities of the 21st century. By promoting geographical literacy in our schools and in our own lives, we can empower ourselves and future generations to become more informed, engaged, and responsible global citizens. The power of geographical literacy is the power to understand our world, and to shape it for the better.

**Listening Script: Section 2**

Good morning, everyone. My name is Dr. Emily Carter, and I'm a geographer. I'm here today to talk to you about the importance of geography in our daily lives. Now, I know what some of you might be thinking. Geography? Isn't that just about memorizing capitals and coloring in maps? Well, I'm here to tell you that geography is so much more than that.

Geography is the study of the Earth's landscapes, peoples, places, and environments. It is, quite simply, about understanding the world around us. And in today's interconnected and rapidly changing world, that understanding has never been more important.

Geography is a very broad subject, but it can be divided into two main branches: physical geography and human geography. Physical geography is the study of the Earth's natural features, such as mountains, rivers, and oceans. Human geography, on the other hand, is the study of how people interact with their environment. This includes everything from the growth of cities to the spread of diseases.

But geography is not just about studying the world; it's also about changing it for the better. Geographers are at the forefront of efforts to address some of the world's most pressing challenges, from climate change to poverty. They are working to develop sustainable solutions that will protect our planet and improve the lives of people around the world.

So, what about the future of geography? Well, I believe that geography will become even more important in the years to come. As our world becomes more complex and interconnected, we will need geographers to help us make sense of it all. We will need them to help us to understand the challenges we face, and to find the solutions that will create a better future for everyone.

Now, I'd like to open it up for questions. But before I do, I'd like to address a few common misconceptions about geography. First, the idea that geography is a boring subject. I couldn't disagree more. Geography is a fascinating and dynamic subject that is constantly evolving. Second, the idea that everyone should study geography. While I would love for everyone to share my passion for the subject, I understand that it's not for everyone. However, I do believe that a basic understanding of geography is essential for everyone. Third, the idea that technology has made geography obsolete. This is simply not true. While technology has certainly changed the way we study geography, it has also made it more important than ever. Finally, the idea that geography is a difficult subject to learn. Like any subject, geography has its challenges, but I believe that with a good teacher and a willingness to learn, anyone can succeed in geography.

Thank you for your time.

**Listening Script: Section 3**

**Professor Davies:** Hello, Sarah and Tom. Thanks for coming in today. As you know, this week we're discussing the role of geography in the 21st century. I'd like to start by hearing your thoughts on the public perception of geography. Sarah?

**Sarah:** Well, I think that for many people, the word "geography" still conjures up images of dusty old maps and lists of capital cities. They don't realize that it's a dynamic and relevant subject that deals with some of the most important issues of our time.

**Professor Davies:** I agree. I think the public perception of geography is often outdated. Tom, what do you think are some of the main challenges facing geographers today?

**Tom:** I think one of the biggest challenges is the complexity of the issues we study. Take climate change, for example. It's a global problem with a huge range of social, economic, and environmental impacts. As geographers, we have to be able to understand all of these different dimensions and how they interact with each other.

**Professor Davies:** That's a very good point. The interconnectedness of global issues is a key theme in modern geography. And what about the use of technology in geography? How has that changed the way we work?

**Tom:** Technology has had a huge impact on geography. We now have access to vast amounts of data from satellites and other sources, and we can use powerful computer programs to analyze that data. This has allowed us to ask new questions and to see the world in new ways.

**Professor Davies:** Yes, the so-called "big data" revolution has been a game-changer for geography. And what about the relationship between physical and human geography? Do you think they are becoming more distinct or more integrated?

**Sarah:** I think they are becoming more integrated. The big challenges we face today, like climate change and sustainable development, require an understanding of both the physical and human dimensions of the world. You can't understand one without the other.

**Professor Davies:** I couldn't agree more. The distinction between physical and human geography is becoming increasingly blurred, and I think that's a positive development. So, what are some of the key skills that geography students develop?

**Sarah:** I think one of the most important skills is the ability to think critically. Geographers are trained to look at issues from multiple perspectives and to evaluate evidence in a rigorous way. This is a skill that is valuable in any profession.

**Professor Davies:** Absolutely. And what about fieldwork? How important is that in geography?

**Sarah:** I think fieldwork is essential. It's one thing to read about a place in a textbook, but it's another thing entirely to go there and experience it for yourself. Fieldwork allows you to see the world in a new way and to develop a deeper understanding of the issues you are studying.

**Professor Davies:** I'm glad you said that. I think fieldwork is one of the things that makes geography such a special subject. So, what are your thoughts on the future of geography? Are you optimistic or pessimistic?

**Tom:** I'm very optimistic. I think geography is more important than ever before. We live in a complex and rapidly changing world, and we need geographers to help us to understand it and to find solutions to the challenges we face.

**Professor Davies:** I share your optimism. I think geography has a very bright future. Finally, do you have any advice for students who are interested in studying geography?

**Listening Script: Section 4**

Good morning. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be talking about geohazards and their impact on society. Geohazards are natural processes that have the potential to cause widespread harm and destruction. They are a major focus of study in the field of physical geography, and they represent one of the most direct and powerful ways in which the Earth’s systems can impact human lives.

There are many different types of geohazards, but they can be broadly categorized into a few main groups. First, we have earthquakes, which are caused by the movement of tectonic plates. These can be incredibly destructive, particularly in densely populated areas. Second, we have volcanoes, which can produce a range of hazards, including lava flows, ash clouds, and pyroclastic flows. Third, we have landslides, which are movements of rock, debris, or earth down a sloped section of land. These can be triggered by heavy rainfall or earthquakes. Finally, we have tsunamis, which are giant waves that are often caused by underwater earthquakes.

The impacts of geohazards on society can be devastating. They can cause significant loss of life and economic damage. They can also disrupt economies and displace populations. The impact of geohazards is often greatest in developing countries, which may not have the resources to prepare for and respond to these events.

So, what can be done to reduce the impact of geohazards? This is where geographers have a crucial role to play. Geographers are involved in assessing the risk of geohazards and developing mitigation strategies. This includes creating hazard maps to identify areas that are at risk, developing early warning systems to give people time to evacuate, and educating the public about the risks and how to prepare for them.

In conclusion, geohazards are a major threat to societies around the world. However, by understanding the science behind these events and by developing effective mitigation strategies, we can reduce their impact and save lives. This is a key area where geography can make a real difference to the world.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The two line graphs illustrate trends in the number of UK students studying human and social geography versus physical geography from the 2007-08 academic year to 2014-15. The data is broken down by all qualifications awarded, student acceptances, all first degrees, upper second class degrees, all higher degrees, and doctorates.

Overall, both branches of geography saw a general upward trend in student numbers across most categories. However, physical geography consistently attracted a higher number of students than human and social geography in nearly all qualifications.

For physical geography, all qualifications awarded and student acceptances showed a significant increase, rising from approximately 3,500 and 2,800 respectively in 2007-08 to peaks of around 5,500 and 4,000 in 2013-14, before a slight dip in the final year. First degrees and upper second class degrees also followed a similar upward trajectory. In contrast, higher degrees and doctorates remained relatively stable, with only a slight increase over the period.

In human and social geography, the trends were similar but the numbers were lower. All qualifications awarded and student acceptances started at around 3,000 and 2,500 respectively, and rose to approximately 4,000 and 3,300 by the end of the period. The number of first degrees and upper second class degrees also saw a steady increase. As with physical geography, higher degrees and doctorates in human and social geography remained relatively low and stable throughout the period.

### Band 9 model essay for Writing Task 2

In an era defined by unprecedented global interconnectedness, the relevance of geography as an academic discipline has become a subject of debate. Some argue that in a world where technology has seemingly erased the constraints of distance, the study of geography is an anachronism. However, I firmly believe that the opposite is true: in our globalized world, a geographical perspective is more critical than ever for understanding and navigating the complex challenges and opportunities we face.

On the one hand, the argument that geography is becoming less important is understandable. With the advent of the internet, instant communication, and high-speed travel, it is easy to feel that the world has shrunk. We can connect with people on the other side of the planet in an instant, and we can order products from anywhere in the world and have them delivered to our doorstep. In this context, it may seem that the physical location of people and places is no longer as important as it once was. Furthermore, the rise of GPS and other navigation technologies has made it easier than ever to find our way around, leading some to believe that we no longer need to have a mental map of the world.

On the other hand, the very forces of globalization that appear to diminish the importance of geography are, in many ways, making it more critical. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that events in one part of the world can have a ripple effect across the globe. A drought in a major food-producing region can lead to higher food prices in our local supermarkets, and a political crisis in a distant country can disrupt global supply chains. A geographical perspective is essential for understanding these complex interdependencies and for making informed decisions as consumers, investors, and citizens.

Furthermore, many of the most pressing challenges we face today, from climate change to pandemics, have a strong geographical dimension. Climate change will have a disproportionate impact on different parts of the world, and a geographical understanding is essential for developing effective and equitable solutions. Similarly, the spread of infectious diseases is shaped by geographical factors such as population density, travel patterns, and access to healthcare. Without a geographical perspective, we cannot hope to address these global challenges in a meaningful way.

In conclusion, while it is true that technology has changed our relationship with distance and location, it has not made geography irrelevant. On the contrary, in our increasingly complex and interconnected world, a geographical perspective is more important than ever. It is the key to understanding the challenges we face, to navigating the opportunities of globalization, and to building a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

### Sample response for Speaking Part 2

(The candidate has 1 minute to prepare)

I’d like to talk about a place I visited a few years ago that I found incredibly interesting: the city of Reykjavik in Iceland. I went there with my family for a short holiday in the winter of 2023. We were only there for four days, but we managed to pack a lot into our trip.

Reykjavik is a fascinating city. It’s the world’s most northerly capital, and it has a really unique atmosphere. It’s a very creative and vibrant place, with a great music scene and lots of interesting street art. We spent a lot of time just wandering around the city, exploring the different neighborhoods and soaking up the atmosphere.

One of the things that I found most interesting about Reykjavik was its relationship with the natural environment. The city is surrounded by incredible landscapes, from volcanoes and glaciers to hot springs and geysers. We took a day trip out of the city to see some of these natural wonders, and it was absolutely breathtaking. We saw the Northern Lights, which was an unforgettable experience, and we also went for a swim in the Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa.

The reason I found Reykjavik so interesting is that it’s a place where nature and culture come together in a really unique way. It’s a city that is shaped by its environment, and the people who live there have a deep respect for the natural world. It’s a place that really makes you think about your own relationship with the environment, and it’s a place that I would love to visit again one day.
