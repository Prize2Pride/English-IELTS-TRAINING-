**The Landscape of Video Game Addiction**

Video game addiction, defined as the compulsive use of the internet to play games, often with other players, has emerged as a significant public health concern in recent years. The proliferation of gaming-capable devices has made accessing games easier than ever, contributing to a rise in what is formally known as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). Research indicates that the neurological effects of this addiction are comparable to those of substance abuse and gambling, with observable changes in the brain's structure and function. Furthermore, a strong correlation has been identified between video game addiction and various psychological and social issues, including depression.

Identifying the signs and symptoms of video game addiction is the first step toward addressing the problem. One of the earliest indicators is a preoccupation with gaming, where an individual constantly thinks or fantasizes about playing, even when engaged in other important activities like schoolwork. This obsession is often accompanied by deceptive behavior, as individuals may lie about the amount of time they spend gaming or conceal their activities from loved ones. They might neglect basic needs such as eating, sleeping, and personal hygiene to maximize their time in the virtual world.

A noticeable loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities is another hallmark of video game addiction. A compelling example is that of a student who, after becoming engrossed in online gaming, abandoned his passion for baseball, a sport in which he had previously excelled. This shift in priorities often leads to social withdrawal, as the individual increasingly isolates themselves from friends and family to dedicate more time to gaming. The friendships forged within the game can start to feel more significant than real-life relationships, further deepening the individual's isolation.

Psychological withdrawal is a particularly distressing symptom, where the inability to play a game leads to feelings of loss and an intense craving to return to it. This can result in emotional instability, with individuals becoming irritable, anxious, or even aggressive when they are unable to play. This defensiveness and anger can be especially pronounced when parents or guardians attempt to set limits on gaming time. For many, the game world becomes a psychological escape, a safe haven from the pressures and difficulties of the real world. Individuals who are shy or feel alienated from their peers may find a sense of confidence and belonging in the virtual environment that they lack in their everyday lives.

Despite the negative consequences, which can range from academic failure and job loss to the deterioration of personal relationships, individuals with a gaming addiction often continue to play. The urge to be the best in the game, particularly in immersive, mission-based games, can create a powerful incentive to keep playing. The more they progress, the more they feel compelled to continue, creating a cycle of compulsive behavior that is difficult to break.

Fortunately, various treatment options are being explored to help individuals overcome video game addiction. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a common treatment for substance abuse, has shown promise in addressing IGD. CBT focuses on identifying and modifying negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the addiction. Another promising approach is the PIPATIC program, an individualized psychotherapy program designed for adolescents with IGD. This multi-faceted program, which incorporates CBT and other therapeutic strategies, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing gaming time and improving overall well-being. In some cases, pharmacotherapy, using medications typically prescribed for depression or ADHD, has also been found to be effective in reducing the symptoms of IGD.

### READING PASSAGE 2

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Psychology of Gaming: Addiction or Adaptation?**

A. The allure of video games is undeniable. From the simple satisfaction of clearing a level in *Pong* to the complex, collaborative worlds of *Minecraft* and *Fortnite*, video games have captivated players for decades. However, for a small percentage of individuals, this pastime can morph into a compulsive behavior with severe consequences, including social isolation, emotional distress, and a profound neglect of real-world responsibilities. This has led to the question: are the games themselves inherently addictive, or are they a symptom of a deeper, pre-existing issue?

B. A groundbreaking study from UC Santa Barbara’s Media Neuroscience Lab sheds light on this complex issue. The research, published in the prestigious JAMA Network Open, suggests that for many, a gaming disorder is not a direct result of the game's design but rather a manifestation of underlying mental health challenges. The study's co-author, Kylie Falcione, explains, “The kids who were already having depressive symptoms and social issues were more likely to get stuck in a cycle of problematic gaming.” This indicates that for these individuals, gaming becomes an unhealthy coping mechanism, a way to manage pre-existing psychopathologies.

C. The study’s longitudinal analysis, which followed 4,289 adolescents in the United States over a four-year period, provides strong evidence for this conclusion. The researchers tracked the participants' mental health, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as their gaming habits. The findings were consistent: those with pre-existing mental health issues were significantly more likely to develop a gaming disorder. This challenges the popular notion that video games are the sole cause of addiction, suggesting instead that they may be a symptom of a larger problem.

D. This is not to say that the games themselves play no role. The intricate reward systems, the sense of community, and the immersive narratives are all powerful draws. However, the research suggests that for most people, these elements are not enough to trigger an addiction. It is the combination of these engaging features with an individual's pre-existing vulnerabilities that can lead to a problematic relationship with gaming. As René Weber, another co-author of the study, cautions, the relationship between psychopathology and gaming disorder can be a “downward spiral,” where each exacerbates the other.

E. The implications of this research for treatment are profound. Simply taking away the video games, a common parental response, may not be an effective long-term solution. Without addressing the underlying mental health issues, the individual may simply find another outlet for their distress or relapse into problematic gaming. A more effective approach, as Falcione suggests, is to “start at the psychopathology level — identify the underlying issues.” This may involve therapy, counseling, or other forms of mental health support.

F. The prevalence of gaming disorder is estimated to be around 3-5% of all gamers, though this figure can vary depending on the definition of the disorder and the population being studied. A meta-analysis of 27 studies found a pooled prevalence level of 5.0%. The study also identified several factors associated with addictive gaming, including emotional dependence, social detachment, and increased gaming time. These factors, combined with the adverse outcomes of addictive gaming, such as lower academic scores and decreased life satisfaction, underscore the seriousness of the issue and the need for effective, evidence-based interventions.

### READING PASSAGE 3

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Debate Over Digital Dependency**

With the global proliferation of video games, a significant debate has emerged within the medical and psychological communities regarding their potential for addiction. While the World Health Organization has officially recognized "gaming disorder" in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), the discussion is far from settled. The core of the debate centers on whether excessive gaming constitutes a unique mental health condition or if it is a manifestation of other underlying disorders. This distinction is crucial, as it shapes the approaches taken for diagnosis, treatment, and public health policy.

A key aspect of understanding this issue is its scale. A systematic review and meta-analysis of numerous studies sought to determine the prevalence of video game addiction. By pooling data from 12 robust studies, researchers calculated the prevalence level of gaming addiction to be approximately 5.0%. This figure, while seemingly small, represents millions of individuals worldwide. The research identified several characteristics of addictive gaming behavior, including spending an excessive amount of time playing, a preference for online gaming over offline, and significant interference with sleep patterns. These behaviors are not just habits but are indicative of a compulsive cycle that individuals find difficult to break.

The factors that contribute to the development of addictive gaming are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of psychological, social, and personal elements. Predictors of addictive gaming include a high degree of emotional dependence on the game, a sense of social detachment from the real world, and increased emotional and psychological stress. For vulnerable individuals, the immersive and rewarding nature of video games can provide a powerful escape from real-life problems, leading to a preference for the virtual world over reality. This can create a feedback loop where the game becomes a coping mechanism, further reinforcing the addictive behavior.

The consequences of this digital dependency are severe and far-reaching. Engaging in addictive gaming has been consistently linked to a range of adverse outcomes. Academically, it can lead to lower grades and a lack of engagement in school. Psychologically, it is associated with increased rates of depression, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. Socially, it can result in a loss of social support and a diminished quality of relationships. Furthermore, individuals may experience a significant decrease in their overall life satisfaction, as their focus narrows to the virtual world at the expense of other life-enriching activities.

Given the significant negative impact of video game addiction, the development of effective interventions is a priority. The research underscores the need for corrective measures that are based on a clear understanding of the identified risk factors. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective, given the diverse factors that contribute to the disorder. Instead, interventions should be tailored to the individual, addressing their specific psychological and social needs. This requires a coherent strategy that can be adapted as new statistical data and a deeper understanding of the condition emerge.

In conclusion, while the academic debate over the precise classification of video game addiction continues, the tangible negative effects on individuals and society are undeniable. The evidence points to a clear need for greater awareness, early identification of at-risk individuals, and the development of targeted, evidence-based interventions to mitigate the harm caused by this modern form of addiction.

## TUTOR GUIDE

**WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER**

The bar chart illustrates the average number of hours per week that people in the UK spent playing video games in 2023, categorized by age group.

Overall, the chart shows a clear trend of decreasing gaming hours with age, with the youngest age group spending the most time gaming and the oldest group spending the least. The 25-34 age group is a notable exception to this trend, with the highest average weekly gaming hours.

The 25-34 age group spent the most time gaming, with an average of 25 hours per week. The 16-24 age group followed, with an average of 15 hours per week. The 10-15 and 35-44 age groups both spent an average of 10 hours per week on gaming. The 45+ age group spent the least amount of time gaming, with an average of just 5 hours per week.

In summary, the data indicates that video gaming is most popular among young adults in the UK, particularly those aged 25-34. The amount of time dedicated to gaming declines significantly in older age groups.

**WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)**

The debate surrounding video game addiction and the responsibility of the gaming industry is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. While personal responsibility is undoubtedly a crucial factor in an individual's choices, the powerful and persuasive design of modern video games cannot be ignored. This essay will argue that while individuals must take ownership of their behavior, the gaming industry also has a significant ethical obligation to mitigate the risks of addiction, and that some form of regulation is therefore necessary.

On the one hand, the argument for personal responsibility is compelling. Adults, in particular, are expected to make their own choices and manage their time effectively. It can be argued that blaming the gaming industry for an individual's addiction is akin to blaming a car manufacturer for a speeding driver. Ultimately, the decision to play a game for an excessive amount of time lies with the individual. Furthermore, millions of people enjoy video games as a harmless hobby without developing any addictive behaviors, which suggests that the problem may lie with the individual's predisposition rather than the games themselves.

On the other hand, the gaming industry employs sophisticated psychological techniques to keep players engaged. Features such as loot boxes, daily rewards, and endless quests are specifically designed to trigger the brain's reward system and encourage compulsive play. These 
techniques can be particularly effective on vulnerable individuals, such as those with pre-existing mental health conditions. To argue that the industry has no responsibility in this context is to ignore the immense power and influence it wields.

In my opinion, a balanced approach is needed. While individuals must be encouraged to take responsibility for their gaming habits, the industry must also be held accountable for the potential harm its products can cause. This could involve stricter regulations on manipulative design features, such as loot boxes, as well as a greater investment in public awareness campaigns and support services for those who are struggling with addiction. The goal should not be to demonize video games, which can be a source of great enjoyment and social connection for many, but to ensure that they are enjoyed in a safe and responsible manner.

In conclusion, while personal responsibility is a key factor in video game addiction, the gaming industry's role in creating and promoting potentially addictive products cannot be overlooked. A combination of individual accountability, industry responsibility, and government regulation is needed to address this growing problem effectively.

**SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE**

I’d like to talk about my younger brother, Tom, who went through a phase of being completely obsessed with a video game called *World of Warcraft*. It’s a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, and he got really into it during his last year of high school.

At first, it seemed like a harmless hobby. He was connecting with his friends online and having fun. But gradually, it started to take over his life. He would play for hours on end, often late into the night. His grades started to slip, and he became withdrawn and irritable. He stopped hanging out with his friends in person and seemed to lose interest in everything else.

The consequences were quite serious. He ended up failing two of his final exams and had to repeat them over the summer. It also put a huge strain on our family. My parents were constantly arguing with him about his gaming, and the atmosphere at home was very tense.

Eventually, my parents decided to intervene. They sat him down and had a long talk with him about their concerns. They didn't just blame him; they tried to understand why he was spending so much time in the game. It turned out that he was feeling a lot of pressure about his exams and his future, and the game was a way for him to escape from that.

They came up with a plan together. They set strict limits on his gaming time and helped him find other ways to cope with his stress, like joining a local football team. It wasn't easy, and there were a few arguments along the way, but eventually, he managed to get his gaming under control. He still plays now and then, but it’s no longer an obsession. He’s much happier and healthier now, and he’s doing really well at university.
