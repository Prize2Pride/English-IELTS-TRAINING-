**READING PASSAGE 1**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 1-13**, which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.

**The Long Road to Equality: A History of LGBTQ+ Rights**

The fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) rights is a story of courage, perseverance, and profound social change. While the latter half of the 20th century saw the most significant strides, the roots of this movement stretch back much further. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed the emergence of the first organizations dedicated to advocating for homosexual rights. In 1897, the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee was founded in Berlin, marking the first-ever attempt to challenge the legal and social persecution of homosexuals. In the United States, the first gay rights organization, the Society for Human Rights, was established in Chicago in 1924 by Henry Gerber. However, these early efforts were often short-lived and faced immense societal opposition.

The post-World War II era brought a new wave of activism. In the United States, the Mattachine Society (1950) and the Daughters of Bilitis (1955) were founded to advocate for the rights of gay men and lesbians, respectively. These organizations, while still operating in a climate of fear and discrimination, provided a sense of community and laid the groundwork for future progress. They challenged the prevailing view of homosexuality as a mental illness and fought against police entrapment and harassment. This period, often referred to as the "homophile" movement, was characterized by a more assimilationist approach, seeking to demonstrate that homosexuals were respectable and deserving of equal rights.

A pivotal moment in the LGBTQ+ rights movement came in June 1969 with the Stonewall Uprising in New York City. The Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in Greenwich Village, was the target of a routine police raid. However, on this occasion, the patrons, along with other members of the community, fought back. The ensuing riots, which lasted for several days, marked a turning point in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights. The Stonewall Uprising is widely considered to be the catalyst for the modern gay liberation movement, shifting the focus from assimilation to a more radical demand for visibility, acceptance, and equal rights.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a surge in activism and the formation of numerous LGBTQ+ rights organizations. The first Gay Pride marches were held in several cities in 1970 to commemorate the Stonewall Uprising. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses, a major victory for the movement. The National LGBTQ Task Force was also founded in 1973, becoming a powerful voice for LGBTQ+ rights at the national level. However, this period was also marked by the devastating impact of the AIDS epidemic, which disproportionately affected the gay community. The crisis spurred the formation of organizations like ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), which used direct action to demand a more urgent response from the government and the medical establishment.

The late 20th and early 21st centuries have been characterized by significant legal and political victories. The fight for marriage equality gained momentum, with the Netherlands becoming the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001. In the United States, a series of court battles and legislative changes culminated in the 2015 Supreme Court decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Other milestones include the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," a policy that had barred openly gay and lesbian individuals from serving in the US military, and the increasing recognition of transgender rights.

Despite the remarkable progress that has been made, the struggle for full equality is far from over. LGBTQ+ individuals around the world continue to face discrimination, violence, and legal challenges. The fight for transgender rights, in particular, has become a major focus of the movement in recent years. The journey towards a world where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, is ongoing. The history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of activism, solidarity, and the unwavering pursuit of justice.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**Understanding the Mental Health Landscape of the LGBTQ+ Community**

**A.** The pursuit of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals extends beyond legal and social recognition; it encompasses the fundamental right to well-being. A growing body of research has illuminated the significant mental health disparities that exist between LGBTQ+ individuals and their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. These disparities are not inherent to being LGBTQ+ but are rather the result of the unique stressors and challenges that this community faces in a world that is often unwelcoming and discriminatory.

**B.** A key framework for understanding these mental health disparities is the minority stress model. This model posits that LGBTQ+ individuals experience chronic stress as a result of their stigmatized social status. This stress can be both distal, originating from external events such as discrimination and violence, and proximal, stemming from internal processes like the concealment of one's sexual orientation or gender identity, fear of rejection, and internalized homophobia or transphobia. The cumulative effect of these stressors can lead to a higher prevalence of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

**C.** The impact of discrimination on the mental health of LGBTQ+ individuals cannot be overstated. Experiences of discrimination, whether overt or subtle, can have a profound and lasting effect on an individual's psychological well-being. This can range from verbal harassment and bullying to physical violence and systemic discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and healthcare. The fear of discrimination can also lead to a reluctance to seek help, further exacerbating mental health challenges. For many LGBTQ+ individuals, the constant vigilance required to navigate a potentially hostile environment can be emotionally and mentally exhausting.

**D.** Within the LGBTQ+ community, certain subgroups are at an even higher risk of experiencing mental health problems. Transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, for example, often face unique challenges related to gender dysphoria, societal stigma, and a lack of access to gender-affirming healthcare. Bisexual individuals may experience biphobia and erasure from both heterosexual and homosexual communities, leading to feelings of isolation. LGBTQ+ youth are also particularly vulnerable, with studies showing that they are at a significantly higher risk for suicidal ideation and attempts compared to their heterosexual peers.

**E.** Addressing the mental health disparities in the LGBTQ+ community requires a multi-faceted approach. On a societal level, it is crucial to continue to advocate for policies that protect LGBTQ+ individuals from discrimination and promote their inclusion and acceptance. This includes comprehensive non-discrimination laws, inclusive school policies, and public education campaigns to combat stigma and prejudice. In the healthcare system, there is a need for more culturally competent mental health professionals who are trained to understand the unique needs of the LGBTQ+ community.

**F.** On an individual and community level, fostering resilience and a sense of belonging is paramount. The support of family, friends, and the broader LGBTQ+ community can be a powerful protective factor against the negative effects of minority stress. Access to LGBTQ+-affirming mental health services, support groups, and community centers can provide a safe space for individuals to connect with others, share their experiences, and build a sense of community. Ultimately, creating a world where LGBTQ+ individuals can not only survive but thrive requires a collective effort to dismantle the systems of oppression that contribute to mental health disparities.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Global Landscape of LGBTQ+ Rights: A World of Contrasts**

The 21st century has witnessed a significant acceleration in the global movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) rights. An increasing number of countries have taken steps to recognize the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, from decriminalizing same-sex relationships to legalizing same-sex marriage. However, the global landscape remains a patchwork of progress and persecution, with vast disparities in legal recognition and social acceptance across different regions of the world.

Europe and the Americas have been at the forefront of this wave of progress. The Netherlands became the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001, and since then, many other European nations have followed suit. In the Americas, Canada was an early leader, legalizing same-sex marriage in 2005. The 2015 Supreme Court ruling in *Obergefell v. Hodges* in the United States was a landmark victory for marriage equality. These legal advancements have been accompanied by a growing social acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals in these regions, although challenges and discrimination still persist.

In stark contrast to the progress in Europe and the Americas, many countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia continue to criminalize same-sex relationships. As of 2024, homosexuality is illegal in over 60 countries, and in several of these, it is punishable by death. These laws not only violate the fundamental human rights of LGBTQ+ individuals but also create a climate of fear and persecution, making it difficult for them to live openly and safely. The legacy of colonial-era laws is a significant factor in the continued criminalization of homosexuality in many of these countries.

International organizations such as the United Nations and Human Rights Watch have played a crucial role in advocating for the global decriminalization of homosexuality and the protection of LGBTQ+ rights. The UN Human Rights Council has passed several resolutions calling for an end to violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These organizations work to raise awareness, monitor human rights abuses, and support local LGBTQ+ activists who are on the front lines of the struggle for equality.

The fight for transgender rights has also gained prominence on the global stage. A growing number of countries have implemented laws that allow transgender individuals to legally change their gender without undergoing surgery. However, transgender people continue to face significant barriers to healthcare, employment, and social acceptance. The global transgender rights movement is working to challenge the discrimination and violence that transgender individuals face and to advocate for their right to self-determination.

The future of the global LGBTQ+ rights movement is likely to be characterized by both continued progress and persistent challenges. While the trend towards greater legal recognition and social acceptance is expected to continue, there is also a growing backlash against LGBTQ+ rights in some parts of the world. The struggle for a world where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of discrimination or violence, is a global one, and it requires the continued efforts of activists, allies, and international organizations.

**Man:** My mobile is 07700 900123.

**Woman:** Great. Now, we provide all our volunteers with a T-shirt. What size do you need?

**Man:** I'm a medium, please.

**Woman:** Medium. Okay. Have you volunteered with us before, or have you got any other volunteer experience?

**Man:** I haven't volunteered at Pride before, but I did help out at a music festival last year. I was helping with stewarding.

**Woman:** Excellent. And what kind of role are you interested in for the parade? We have a few different options.

**Man:** I'm happy to do whatever is needed, but I'd be particularly interested in being a parade marshal.

**Woman:** Okay, I'll put that down as your preference. We have a volunteer briefing session on Wednesday evening. Can you make that?

**Man:** Yes, I can. And I'm available all day on the day of the parade.

**Woman:** Fantastic. And finally, can I take an emergency contact name and number?

**Man:** Yes, it's my brother, David. His number is 07700 900888.

**Woman:** And what's your relationship to David?

**Man:** He's my brother.

**Woman:** Great. Is there anything else you'd like to add?

**Man:** Actually, yes. I have a first aid certification.

**Woman:** That's brilliant! Thank you, Sarah. We'll be in touch soon with more details.

**SECTION 2**

**Presenter:** Welcome to the Rainbow Community Centre. My name is Alex, and I'm the centre manager. I'm here today to tell you a little bit about the work we do and the services we offer. The centre has been serving the LGBTQ+ community for over 20 years. We are a registered charity, and our mission is to provide a safe and supportive space for all members of our community.

We run a wide range of services and activities. Our weekly social group is a great way to meet new people and make friends. It's open to everyone in the LGBTQ+ community, and it's a very relaxed and informal setting. We also have a monthly film night, where we show a selection of LGBTQ+ films. It's on the first Tuesday of every month, and it's a great way to see some fantastic films and meet other film lovers.

We also offer a range of support services. Our 'Know Your Rights' workshop is a must for anyone who wants to learn more about their legal rights. It's led by a team of experienced lawyers, and it covers a wide range of topics, from employment law to housing rights. We also have a dedicated youth group for people aged 16 to 25. It's a safe and supportive space for young people to explore their identity and connect with their peers.

The Transgender Support Network provides a range of services for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, including peer support groups and advocacy services. The Rainbow Families Project is for LGBTQ+ parents and their children. We offer a range of activities and support services for families. The Silver Rainbows Group is for our older members. It's a great way to socialize and connect with other older LGBTQ+ people. And finally, our MindOut service provides confidential counselling and mental health support. If you're interested in any of our services, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We're here to help.

**SECTION 3**

**Chloe:** So, Liam, what did you think of the lecture on LGBTQ+ representation in the media?

**Liam:** I thought it was really interesting. I hadn't really thought about the 'Bury Your Gays' trope before, but it makes so much sense now that the lecturer explained it.

**Chloe:** I know, right? It's such a harmful and outdated stereotype. It's like, as soon as a queer character gets a moment of happiness, they're killed off. It's so frustrating.

**Liam:** Definitely. And I think the lecturer made a good point about how the increase in LGBTQ+ representation has been quite slow and tokenistic. It's often just one gay character in a show, and they're usually a sidekick or a stereotype.

**Chloe:** Exactly. And the 'coming out' narrative is so overused. It's an important story to tell, of course, but it's not the only story. There's so much more to the LGBTQ+ experience than just coming out.

**Liam:** I agree. And I think that's especially true for transgender characters. They're so often portrayed as tragic figures, and their stories are always about their transition. It would be great to see more trans characters who are just living their lives.

**Chloe:** Absolutely. I was also really interested in what the lecturer said about the impact of social media on the formation of LGBTQ+ communities. It's amazing how people can connect with each other and find support online.

**Liam:** Yeah, it's a double-edged sword, though, isn't it? Social media can be a great source of community, but it can also be a really toxic environment, especially for LGBTQ+ youth.

**Chloe:** That's true. So, for our research project, I was thinking we could focus on the representation of a specific identity within the LGBTQ+ community. We could look at how bisexuality is portrayed in television dramas, for example.

**Liam:** That's a great idea. It's a really under-researched area, and I think we could find some really interesting things. We could look at how the 'confused' or 'promiscuous' bisexual stereotype is perpetuated.

**Chloe:** Exactly. Okay, so let's start by creating a list of potential sources. We can look for academic articles, as well as reviews and articles from LGBTQ+ publications.

**Liam:** Sounds good. And then we can meet with our tutor to discuss our ideas in more detail.

**SECTION 4**

**Lecturer:** Good morning, everyone. In today's lecture, we're going to be talking about the psychology of Pride. Now, pride is a complex emotion. It can be seen as a positive emotion, a celebration of one's achievements and identity. But it can also be seen as a negative emotion, a form of arrogance or hubris. In the context of the LGBTQ+ community, however, pride is a powerful and transformative emotion. It is a rejection of the shame and stigma that have been historically associated with being LGBTQ+.

The first Pride marches were not celebrations. They were protests. They were a response to the police raid on the Stonewall Inn in 1969, and they were a demand for equal rights and an end to police brutality. The rainbow flag, which was designed by Gilbert Baker in 1978, has become a powerful symbol of the LGBTQ+ community. It is a symbol of diversity and inclusivity, and it represents the hope for a more equal and just world.

So, what are the psychological benefits of Pride? Well, for a start, Pride events can foster a sense of community and belonging. They can reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are all too common in the LGBTQ+ community. Publicly celebrating one's identity can also have a positive impact on self-esteem and mental well-being. It can be a powerful antidote to the effects of discrimination and prejudice.

However, it's also important to acknowledge the criticisms of Pride. Some people argue that the original political message of Pride has been diluted by commercialization. The term 'pinkwashing' has been coined to describe the practice of corporations using LGBTQ+ rights as a marketing tool to promote a positive public image. There is also a growing debate about the role of police in Pride parades, with many activists arguing that their presence is a betrayal of the radical roots of the movement.

So, what is the future of Pride? It's likely to be a future that is more inclusive and more intersectional. There is a growing recognition that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is interconnected with the fight for racial justice, economic justice, and social justice. The future of Pride will likely involve a greater focus on activism and a return to the political roots of the movement. It will be a future where Pride is not just a celebration, but a continued fight for a better world for all.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The line graph illustrates changes in public opinion towards same-sex marriage in a specific European country over a twenty-year period, from 2005 to 2025. The data is presented as percentages of the population holding positive, neutral, or negative views.

Overall, the most striking trend is the significant increase in positive attitudes towards same-sex marriage, which became the majority viewpoint over the period. Conversely, both neutral and negative opinions saw a decline, with negative views decreasing most sharply in the first half of the period.

In 2005, neutral views were the most common, at 40%, while positive and negative opinions were equal at 30% each. Over the next decade, support for same-sex marriage grew steadily, rising to 55% by 2015 and overtaking neutral views to become the dominant opinion. During the same period, negative views halved, dropping to just 10%, while neutral attitudes saw a modest decrease to 35%.

From 2015 to 2025, the trend of growing support continued, with the percentage of people holding positive views projected to reach 70%. In contrast, neutral opinions are expected to fall more steeply to 20%. The proportion of the population with negative views is predicted to remain stable at its 2015 level of 10%.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The question of whether the pursuit of LGBTQ+ rights should be a global priority is a complex and often contentious issue. Some contend that in a world grappling with widespread poverty and the existential threat of climate change, focusing on LGBTQ+ rights is a misallocation of resources. However, a more convincing argument is that the protection of these rights is not a distraction but rather an indispensable component of the broader struggle for universal human rights.

On the one hand, the argument that more pressing issues demand our immediate attention is understandable. When millions of people lack access to clean water, food, and basic healthcare, it can seem indulgent to focus on issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Proponents of this view might argue that the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is a luxury that can only be afforded by developed nations. They might point to the fact that in many parts of the world, the very survival of large segments of the population is at stake, and that resources should be directed towards addressing these fundamental needs first.

On the other hand, to dismiss the fight for LGBTQ+ rights as a secondary concern is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. This principle is indivisible, and it applies to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. To deny LGBTQ+ people their rights is to create a hierarchy of humanity, in which some are deemed more worthy of protection than others. Furthermore, the fight for LGBTQ+ rights is not separate from the fight against poverty and other forms of social injustice. LGBTQ+ individuals are often disproportionately affected by poverty, homelessness, and a lack of access to healthcare, precisely because of the discrimination they face.

In my opinion, the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights is not a distraction but a crucial and integral part of the human rights agenda. A society that tolerates discrimination against one group is a society that is more likely to tolerate discrimination against others. The fight for equality is a universal one, and the progress we make in one area can have a positive ripple effect in others. By creating a more inclusive and just world for LGBTQ+ people, we are creating a more just and equitable world for everyone. The struggle for human rights is not a zero-sum game; it is a collective endeavor in which the liberation of one group is inextricably linked to the liberation of all.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

I’d like to talk about a time when I stood up for a friend who was being bullied. This happened a few years ago when I was in university. I was in the library with a group of friends, and one of my friends, who is gay, was being subjected to some really nasty homophobic comments from a group of students at a nearby table. They were sniggering and making jokes at his expense, and it was clear that he was becoming increasingly uncomfortable.

At first, I was hesitant to say anything. I’m not a confrontational person by nature, and I was worried about making the situation worse. But then I looked at my friend’s face, and I could see how hurt and humiliated he was. I knew I couldn’t just sit there and do nothing. So, I took a deep breath and walked over to the other table. I calmly but firmly told them that their comments were not acceptable and that they needed to stop. I explained that their words were hurtful and that they were creating a hostile environment for other students.

I was really nervous, and my voice was shaking a little, but I was also determined to make my point. The students were taken aback at first, and they tried to laugh it off, but I stood my ground. I told them that I wasn’t going to leave until they apologized to my friend. Eventually, one of them mumbled an apology, and they all went quiet. I went back to my table, and my friend gave me a grateful smile. I felt a huge sense of relief, but also a sense of pride in myself for having done the right thing.

It was important for me to take a stand because I believe that we all have a responsibility to challenge prejudice and discrimination wherever we see it. It’s not enough to just be a passive bystander. We have to be active allies and use our voices to support those who are being targeted. It wasn’t easy, but I’m so glad I did it. It made me realize that even one person can make a difference.
