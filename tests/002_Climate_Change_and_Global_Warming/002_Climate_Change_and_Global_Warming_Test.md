### READING SECTION (40 questions)

**PASSAGE 1**

The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the Earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate, and that human activity is the principal driver of this change. The primary cause of global warming is the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is the result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space and thus warming the planet.

The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a turning point in human history and the Earth's climate. The widespread adoption of fossil fuels – coal, oil, and gas – to power factories, generate electricity, and fuel transportation has led to a massive increase in CO2 emissions. Deforestation, the clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization, is another significant contributor to the rise in GHGs. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, and their removal reduces the planet's capacity to regulate this gas.

Agriculture also plays a substantial role in climate change. Livestock, particularly cattle, produce large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, during their digestive processes. The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. Furthermore, industrial processes, such as the manufacturing of cement and chemicals, release a variety of potent greenhouse gases.

Beyond the increased concentration of greenhouse gases, other factors contribute to climate change, albeit to a lesser extent. Changes in land use, such as the conversion of forests to agricultural land, can alter the Earth's reflectivity, leading to further warming. Variations in solar activity and volcanic eruptions can also have short-term effects on the climate, but their long-term impact is negligible compared to the influence of human activities.

The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and multifaceted. Rising global temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt at an accelerated rate, leading to a rise in sea levels. This poses a significant threat to coastal communities and ecosystems. Climate change is also leading to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and wildfires. These events can have devastating impacts on human life, infrastructure, and agriculture.

The scientific evidence for climate change is unequivocal, and the need for urgent action is clear. Mitigating climate change will require a global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and improve energy efficiency. Adapting to the impacts of climate change will also be crucial, particularly for vulnerable communities. The challenge is immense, but so too is the opportunity to create a more sustainable and resilient future for all.

**PASSAGE 2**

**The Fragile Balance: Climate Change and Global Ecosystems**

**A**
The intricate tapestry of life on Earth is woven from a delicate balance of interconnected ecosystems, each with its unique set of flora and fauna. These ecosystems, from the frozen tundra of the Arctic to the vibrant coral reefs of the tropics, are highly sensitive to changes in their environment. Climate change, driven by the relentless increase in global temperatures, is now exerting unprecedented pressure on these fragile systems, threatening to unravel the very fabric of biodiversity.

**B**
One of the most visible and immediate impacts of climate change on ecosystems is the alteration of species' geographical ranges. As temperatures rise, many species are forced to migrate to higher latitudes or altitudes in search of cooler habitats. This can lead to a cascade of ecological consequences, as species are introduced to new environments where they may become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources. Conversely, species that are unable to move, due to geographical barriers or limited mobility, face the risk of extinction.

**C**
The world's oceans are bearing the brunt of climate change, absorbing a significant portion of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This has led to two critical phenomena: ocean acidification and coral bleaching. Ocean acidification, the decrease in the pH of the ocean, makes it more difficult for marine organisms such as corals, clams, and oysters to build their shells and skeletons. Coral bleaching, the expulsion of the symbiotic algae that live within corals, is a direct result of rising water temperatures. Widespread coral bleaching can lead to the death of entire reef ecosystems, which support a quarter of all marine life.

**D**
Terrestrial ecosystems are also undergoing profound changes. Rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and intense droughts, wildfires, and pest outbreaks. These disturbances can have devastating impacts on forests, grasslands, and other habitats. For example, prolonged droughts can weaken trees, making them more susceptible to insect infestations and disease. Wildfires, fueled by dry conditions and high winds, can destroy vast areas of forest, releasing massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and further exacerbating climate change.

**E**
The timing of seasonal events, such as the flowering of plants, the migration of birds, and the emergence of insects, is also being disrupted by climate change. This phenomenon, known as phenological mismatch, can have serious consequences for species that rely on these seasonal cues for their survival. For instance, if migratory birds arrive at their breeding grounds before their primary food source has emerged, they may struggle to find enough food to feed their young. This can lead to a decline in bird populations and disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

**F**
The impacts of climate change on ecosystems are not just a matter of ecological concern; they also have significant implications for human well-being. Healthy ecosystems provide a wide range of essential services, such as clean air and water, food, and medicine. The degradation of ecosystems due to climate change can therefore have a direct impact on human health, livelihoods, and economies. Protecting and restoring ecosystems is not only crucial for preserving biodiversity but also for ensuring a sustainable future for humanity.

**PASSAGE 3**

**Innovations in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation**

The global response to climate change has spurred a wave of innovation, as scientists, engineers, and policymakers work to develop and implement solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of a warming world. These innovations span a wide range of sectors, from energy and transportation to agriculture and infrastructure, and offer a glimmer of hope in the face of a daunting global challenge.

One of the most significant areas of innovation is in the field of renewable energy. The cost of solar and wind power has plummeted in recent years, making them increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Advances in energy storage technologies, such as batteries and pumped-hydro storage, are helping to address the intermittency of renewable energy sources, ensuring a reliable supply of clean electricity. Furthermore, emerging technologies, such as green hydrogen and advanced geothermal systems, hold the promise of further decarbonizing the energy sector.

In the transportation sector, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is well underway. Automakers are investing billions of dollars in the development of new EV models, and governments are offering incentives to encourage their adoption. Innovations in battery technology are leading to longer ranges and faster charging times, making EVs a more practical option for a wider range of consumers. In addition to EVs, there is growing interest in sustainable aviation fuels and the development of high-speed rail networks to reduce the carbon footprint of travel.

The agricultural sector, a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, is also a hotbed of innovation. Precision agriculture technologies, such as GPS-guided tractors and drones, are helping farmers to optimize the use of fertilizers and water, reducing nitrous oxide emissions and improving crop yields. The development of alternative proteins, such as plant-based meats and cultivated meat, has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of livestock farming. Furthermore, advances in soil carbon sequestration techniques are helping to turn agricultural lands into carbon sinks.

In addition to mitigation efforts, there is a growing focus on climate change adaptation. This involves adjusting to the actual or expected effects of climate change, in order to minimize the negative impacts and take advantage of any opportunities. Innovations in this area include the development of drought-resistant crops, the construction of sea walls and other coastal defenses, and the implementation of early warning systems for extreme weather events. Nature-based solutions, such as the restoration of mangroves and wetlands, are also gaining traction as a cost-effective way to enhance resilience to climate change.

While these innovations offer a promising path forward, their successful implementation will require significant investment, supportive government policies, and international cooperation. The scale of the climate challenge is immense, and there is no single silver bullet solution. However, the ingenuity and determination of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs around the world provide a reason for optimism. By harnessing the power of innovation, we can build a more sustainable and resilient future for all.

Good morning everyone, and welcome to Glacier National Park. My name is David, and I’m a **(11) park ranger** here. I’m delighted to be your guide today and to tell you a little bit about this beautiful park and how it’s being affected by climate change.

As you can see, the park is home to some of the most stunning scenery in the country, with its majestic mountains, pristine lakes, and, of course, its glaciers. However, this breathtaking landscape is under threat. The park’s glaciers are melting at an alarming rate, and scientists predict that they could disappear completely by the year 2030. This is a direct result of rising global temperatures, and it’s having a profound impact on the park’s ecosystems.

The most significant impact of climate change on the park’s trees is that they are becoming more susceptible to **(12) disease and pests**. The warmer winters are allowing pine beetles to survive in greater numbers, and these insects are devastating our forests. We are also seeing an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires, which are further damaging our forests and threatening the park’s wildlife.

The park’s bird population is also being affected. Many species are having to shift their ranges to higher elevations in search of cooler temperatures, and this is leading to increased competition for food and nesting sites. To help our feathered friends, we are creating **(13) artificial nesting sites** and working to restore their natural habitats.

So, what can you, as visitors, do to help protect the park? The most important thing is to **(14) stay on the designated trails**. This helps to prevent soil erosion and protect our delicate plant life. Please also remember not to feed the animals, as this can make them dependent on humans and disrupt their natural behaviours. And, of course, please don’t take any plants or rocks home with you as souvenirs.

Now, I’d like to talk about the future of some of the park’s most iconic animals. The **(15) mountain goat**, with its thick white coat, is well-adapted to the cold, but as temperatures rise, its habitat is shrinking. We expect their population to **(16) decrease**. The **(17) grizzly bear**, on the other hand, is a more adaptable species, and we predict that its population will **(18) remain stable**. The **(19) pika**, a small mammal that lives in high-altitude environments, is extremely vulnerable to heat stress, and we are very concerned that its population will **(20) decrease**. The **(21) bighorn sheep** population is also expected to **(22) decrease** due to habitat loss and disease. Finally, the **(23) elk** population is expected to **(24) remain stable**, as they are able to migrate to new areas in search of food.

We are doing everything we can to protect this incredible park and its wildlife, but we need your help. By being mindful of your impact and supporting our conservation efforts, you can help us to ensure that Glacier National Park remains a treasure for generations to come. Thank you.

**SECTION 3**

**Maria:** So, David, for our presentation on the ethical dimensions of climate change, I was thinking we could start by defining the concept of ‘climate justice’.

**David:** Good idea, Maria. So, climate justice is essentially about the fair distribution of the burdens and benefits of climate action. It recognizes that the impacts of climate change are not felt equally, and that those who have contributed the least to the problem are often the most **(22) vulnerable** to its effects.

**Maria:** Exactly. And that’s why it’s so important to consider the historical responsibility for climate change. Developed countries have been emitting greenhouse gases for much longer than **(23) developing countries**, and so they have a greater responsibility to take action.

**David:** Right. And that leads us to the concept of ‘intergenerational equity’. The idea that we have a moral obligation to protect the planet for **(24) future generations**. Our actions today will have a direct impact on their lives, and they will be the ones who have to deal with the consequences of our inaction.

**Maria:** I think that’s a really powerful point. But what do you think is the biggest challenge in addressing these ethical dimensions of climate change?

**David:** For me, it’s the difficulty in getting countries to **(25) cooperate**. Climate change is a global problem, and it requires a global solution. But all too often, national self-interest gets in the way of meaningful action.

**Maria:** I agree. And that’s where the issue of ‘carbon leakage’ comes in. When one country implements stricter environmental regulations, it can lead to companies moving their operations to countries with more lenient rules. So, what’s the solution?

**David:** Well, one idea that’s gaining traction is the implementation of **(26) border carbon adjustments**. This would involve placing a tax on imports from countries that don’t have a carbon price, which would level the playing field and encourage other countries to take action.

**Maria:** That’s an interesting idea. But I’m also concerned about the potential social impacts of some climate change solutions. For example, the transition to a low-carbon economy could lead to **(27) job losses** in the fossil fuel industry.

**David:** That’s a valid point. We need to ensure that the transition is just and equitable, and that we support workers and communities that are affected by the changes. So, for the rest of our presentation, should we focus on some **(28) case studies** of climate justice in practice?

**Maria:** Yes, that’s a great idea. We could look at some examples of how communities are adapting to the impacts of climate change, and how they are fighting for their right to a healthy environment.

**David:** Perfect. And to conclude, we can reiterate the point that **(29) ethical considerations** are crucial for effective climate action. It’s not just about the science and the economics; it’s about our values and our vision for a just and sustainable future.

**Maria:** Exactly. Okay, so let’s **(30) do more research** on those case studies and then we can start writing the presentation.

**David:** Sounds like a plan.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to talk about a controversial and complex topic: geoengineering. Geoengineering is the large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system to counteract climate change. It’s a field that is fraught with scientific, ethical, and political challenges, but it’s one that we can no longer afford to ignore.

There are two main categories of geoengineering: Carbon Dioxide Removal, or CDR, and Solar Radiation Management, or SRM. CDR aims to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, while SRM aims to reflect a small proportion of the sun’s energy back into space.

Let’s start with CDR. Some of the most well-known CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, which is simply planting more trees. Another is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, which involves burning biomass for energy and then capturing and storing the resulting CO2. And then there’s direct air capture, or DAC, which uses chemical processes to capture CO2 directly from the air.

While these methods sound promising, they all have significant challenges. CDR methods are often very **(31) expensive** and require vast amounts of land and energy. There are also concerns about the long-term effectiveness and **(32) side effects** of some of these technologies.

Now, let’s turn to SRM. The most talked-about SRM method is stratospheric aerosol injection, which would involve injecting reflective particles, such as sulfur dioxide, into the stratosphere to mimic the cooling effect of a large volcanic eruption. Other ideas include marine cloud brightening, which would involve spraying sea salt into marine clouds to make them more reflective, and cirrus cloud thinning, which would aim to remove high-altitude cirrus clouds to allow more heat to escape from the Earth.

SRM is a much more controversial topic than CDR, and for good reason. The main problem is that it doesn’t address the root cause of climate change, which is the high concentration of **(33) greenhouse gases** in the atmosphere. It’s essentially a temporary fix, a band-aid on a much deeper wound.

There are also serious concerns about the potential **(34) unintended consequences** of SRM. We simply don’t know what the full impact of these technologies would be on weather patterns, the ozone layer, and global ecosystems. And then there’s the ‘termination shock’. If we were to start SRM and then suddenly stop, global temperatures would rise rapidly, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

And finally, there are the significant **(35) governance** and ethical concerns. Who gets to decide whether or not to deploy these technologies? Who is liable if something goes wrong? There is currently no international **(36) framework** for geoengineering research and deployment, and this is a major problem.

We need to have a global conversation about the risks and benefits of these technologies, and any decisions about their use must be made in a transparent and **(37) inclusive** way.

In conclusion, geoengineering is not a ‘silver bullet’ solution to climate change. It should be seen as a potential complement to, not a substitute for, **(38) mitigation** efforts. We need to do much more **(39) research** to understand the potential impacts of these technologies. But the most important thing we can do to address climate change is to reduce our **(40) emissions**.

Thank you.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### Model answer for Writing Task 1

The provided line graph illustrates the change in average global temperatures from 1880 to 2020, expressed as a temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius. Overall, the graph clearly indicates a significant and accelerating upward trend in global temperatures over the 140-year period.

From 1880 to approximately 1940, the temperature anomaly fluctuated, but remained relatively stable, with most years showing temperatures slightly below the long-term average. There were some minor peaks and troughs during this period, but no clear warming trend was evident.

However, from the 1940s onwards, a clear and consistent warming trend began to emerge. The temperature anomaly started to rise steadily, and by the 1980s, it had surpassed the long-term average. The rate of warming appears to have accelerated in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century.

The last few decades of the period shown on the graph are particularly striking. From the 1980s to 2020, the temperature anomaly increased dramatically, with each successive decade being warmer than the last. The year 2020 is shown to have the highest temperature anomaly of the entire period, highlighting the unprecedented rate of warming in recent times.

In conclusion, the graph demonstrates a clear and alarming trend of global warming, with a particularly rapid increase in temperatures in recent decades.

### Model essay for Writing Task 2 (Band 9 level)

The assertion that climate change is the most significant threat facing the world today is a topic of intense debate. While it is undeniable that global warming poses a profound and existential challenge to humanity, it is also true that other pressing issues, such as poverty and global health crises, demand our immediate attention. This essay will discuss both these views before offering a concluding perspective.

On the one hand, the argument that climate change is the preeminent global threat is compelling. The scientific consensus is unequivocal: the Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate, and the consequences are already being felt across the globe. Rising sea levels threaten to inundate coastal communities, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, and ecosystems are on the brink of collapse. The long-term and potentially irreversible nature of these impacts sets climate change apart from other global challenges. Furthermore, the effects of climate change are not confined to the environmental sphere; they have far-reaching social and economic consequences, exacerbating poverty, threatening food security, and potentially leading to mass migration and conflict. From this perspective, climate change is not just another issue on the global agenda; it is the defining challenge of our time, one that has the potential to undermine all other aspects of human progress.

On the other hand, it is equally valid to argue that other issues, such as poverty and global health, are more immediate and pressing. For the billions of people living in extreme poverty, the daily struggle for survival takes precedence over the more abstract threat of climate change. Lack of access to clean water, food, and healthcare are immediate and life-threatening concerns that cannot be ignored. Similarly, global health crises, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate the devastating impact that infectious diseases can have on societies and economies. It can be argued that without addressing these fundamental issues of human well-being, it is impossible to build the resilient and equitable societies that are needed to tackle the long-term challenge of climate change. From this viewpoint, poverty and global health are not secondary issues, but rather foundational challenges that must be addressed as a matter of urgency.

In my opinion, while the arguments for prioritizing poverty and global health are valid, climate change is ultimately the most significant threat facing the world today. This is because climate change is a threat multiplier; it exacerbates existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, and has the potential to unravel decades of development progress. The impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately on the world’s poorest and most vulnerable populations, the very people who are already struggling with poverty and poor health. Therefore, tackling climate change is not a separate issue, but rather an integral part of the broader agenda of sustainable development. By investing in a green and resilient future, we can not only mitigate the risks of climate change, but also create new opportunities for economic growth, improve public health, and reduce poverty. In conclusion, while we must not lose sight of the immediate challenges of poverty and global health, we must also recognize that climate change is the overarching threat that will ultimately determine the future of our planet and our species.

### Speaking Part 2 sample response

I’d like to talk about a time I experienced an extreme weather event, which was a major flood that hit my hometown a few years ago. It was in the middle of the summer, and we’d had an unusually long period of heavy rain. The river that runs through my town started to rise rapidly, and before we knew it, the water was spilling over its banks and into the streets.

The weather was absolutely terrible. The rain was relentless, and the wind was howling. The sky was a dark, ominous grey, and it felt like the world was ending. I remember looking out of my window and seeing the street below transformed into a raging torrent of brown, murky water. Cars were submerged, and furniture was floating down the street. It was a surreal and terrifying sight.

During the flood, my family and I were trapped in our house for two days. We were lucky that our house was on slightly higher ground, so the water didn’t come inside, but many of our neighbours were not so fortunate. We spent the time listening to the radio for updates and trying to stay calm. I remember feeling a mixture of fear, anxiety, and disbelief. It was hard to comprehend that this was happening to our town, a place I had always known as safe and peaceful.

Looking back, the experience was a real wake-up call. It made me realize how vulnerable we are to the power of nature, and how important it is to be prepared for these kinds of events. It also brought our community closer together. In the aftermath of the flood, everyone rallied around to help each other, and it was heart-warming to see the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The flood was a devastating event, but it also taught me a valuable lesson about resilience and the importance of community.
