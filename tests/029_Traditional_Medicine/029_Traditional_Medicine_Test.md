**The Enduring Legacy of Traditional Medicine**

For centuries, across a multitude of cultures, people have relied on traditional healers, home remedies, and ancient medicinal knowledge to address their health and well-being. According to a 2019 report from the World Health Organization (WHO), 170 member states have acknowledged the use of traditional medicine by their populations. These systems, which include acupuncture, herbal medicines, indigenous traditional medicine, homeopathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, Ayurvedic, and Unani medicine, are diverse and deeply rooted in cultural history.

While sometimes viewed as pre-scientific and destined to be replaced by modern, evidence-based medicine, traditional medicine has made profound contributions to contemporary science. Approximately 40% of today's pharmaceutical products have their origins in nature and traditional knowledge. Landmark drugs such as aspirin, artemisinin, and treatments for childhood cancer all have stories that begin with traditional practices. A closer examination of these discoveries reveals that modern scientists often built upon the foundations laid by centuries of traditional wisdom.

A prime example of this is the discovery of artemisinin, a potent anti-malarial drug. In the 1970s, Chinese scientist Tu Youyou was tasked with finding a cure for chloroquine-resistant malaria. After testing over 240,000 compounds with no success, she turned to ancient Chinese medical texts. A reference to sweet wormwood for treating intermittent fevers provided the crucial clue. In 1971, her team successfully isolated artemisinin from the plant, a compound that proved highly effective against malaria. Now recommended by the WHO as a primary treatment for the disease, its discovery earned Tu Youyou a Nobel Prize in 2015 and has saved millions of lives.

Similarly, the story of aspirin begins with the willow tree. For over 3,500 years, civilizations like the Sumerians and Egyptians used willow bark as a pain reliever and anti-inflammatory agent. In ancient Greece, it was used to ease childbirth pain and reduce fevers. In 1897, a chemist at Bayer, Felix Hoffmann, synthesized aspirin, a drug that has since become one of the most widely used medications in the world, with benefits ranging from pain relief to the prevention of heart attacks and strokes.

Beyond sweet wormwood and willow bark, a host of other plants have yielded significant medical breakthroughs. The Madagascar periwinkle, mentioned in Mesopotamian folklore and both Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional medicine, is the source of vinblastine and vincristine, two crucial drugs used in the treatment of childhood cancers. Hawthorn and foxglove have long been used to treat cardiovascular diseases, while shikimic acid from star anise is a key component in the antiviral medication Tamiflu. The wild Mexican yam provided the basis for norethindrone, a key ingredient in early contraceptive pills. These examples underscore how modern medicine has consistently drawn upon the rich repository of traditional knowledge about the healing properties of the natural world.

Ancient practices have also provided models for public health interventions. The eradication of smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases in human history, was made possible by a vaccine that drew its core principle from the ancient practice of variolation. Dating back to at least 200 BCE in Asia and Africa, variolation involved transferring material from smallpox sores to healthy individuals to induce a milder form of the illness and subsequent immunity. This traditional practice, observed and adopted in various forms across the globe, laid the groundwork for the development of a stable and effective vaccine, ultimately leading to the complete eradication of the disease.

In modern times, practices like yoga and acupuncture are increasingly recognized for their effectiveness in managing chronic health issues. Dr. Susan Wieland of the WHO notes that over 20 clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of yoga for chronic lower back pain, and similar evidence supports the use of acupuncture for pain relief. The ancient Ayurvedic practice of exposing jaundiced newborns to sunlight corresponds to the modern medical treatment of phototherapy, demonstrating that traditional medicine often understood *that* a treatment worked, even if the scientific mechanism was not yet understood. As technology advances, with tools like AI and fMRI, researchers are gaining deeper insights into the mechanisms behind these ancient practices, promising an exciting future for the integration of traditional and modern medicine.

**Reading Passage 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**A Physician’s Tale: Integrating Old and New**

**A.** In the bustling city of Istanbul, a compelling story of medical evolution is unfolding. Dr. Kanat Tayfun, a seasoned general practitioner who transitioned into a role as a pharmaceutical executive, found himself yearning for a more direct and meaningful impact on patient care. This desire led him on a journey to explore how the ancient wisdom of traditional medicine could be combined with the rigors of modern science. His quest was not to replace one with the other, but to synergize them, aiming for enhanced health outcomes across a spectrum of health issues.

**B.** Dr. Tayfun’s exploration into integrative medicine received a significant boost in 2014 when Türkiye’s Ministry of Health enacted a groundbreaking law concerning traditional and complementary medicine. This legislation officially recognized and created a pathway for the certification of 15 different subgroups of traditional practices, allowing them to be formally integrated into the national health-care system. Seizing this opportunity, Dr. Tayfun embarked on a transformative path, ultimately achieving certification in 13 of these diverse therapies, ranging from acupuncture to music therapy.

**C.** At his clinic, located in the University of Health Sciences Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Dr. Tayfun champions a patient-centric philosophy that he feels is becoming less common in contemporary medical practice. “Modern medicine increasingly relies on lab and imaging results,” he observes. “Physicians are growing distant from patients, and a new generation of doctors is less inclined to engage in physical examination.” In contrast, his approach is deeply rooted in listening, observing, and interacting closely with his patients, thereby combining traditional methods of diagnosis with the precision of modern technology.

**D.** The clinic has become a sanctuary for a wide array of patients. Some arrive seeking relief from the persistent burden of chronic pain, while others are grappling with complex autoimmune disorders. According to Dr. Tayfun, a crucial element of the healing process is the sense of being truly heard and treated with dignity. He emphasizes creating an individualized path to recovery for each person. “Given time constraints, most physicians often lack the opportunity for thorough physical examinations. At my clinic, we focus on listening, taking notes, and understanding the patient's condition,” he explains. This patient-focused methodology is a cornerstone of his practice.

**E.** The work of Dr. Tayfun aligns with a broader global movement towards recognizing the value of traditional practices within primary health care. This movement was significantly bolstered by the Sixty-second World Health Assembly in 2009, which, echoing the landmark Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, acknowledged that traditional medicine is integral to primary health care. The Assembly advocated for collaboration between traditional practitioners and primary health-care providers to achieve more holistic and impactful patient outcomes by integrating their respective knowledge and experience.

**F.** The influence of Dr. Tayfun’s work is extending beyond the walls of his clinic. His success, primarily driven by word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied patients, has ignited discussions about the possibility of including traditional and complementary therapies in Türkiye’s national health-care coverage. Furthermore, recognizing his expertise and pioneering efforts, the World Health Organization has collaborated with Dr. Tayfun in drafting a report on the global integration of these medical practices. He sees his role as a bridge between ancient healing arts and modern science, hoping to leave a legacy that demonstrates the profound healing potential of their integration.

**Reading Passage 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Future of Healing: Navigating the Path Forward for Traditional Medicine**

The 21st century is witnessing a significant resurgence of interest in traditional medicine. As globalization connects cultures and information becomes more accessible, patients and practitioners alike are exploring the potential of ancient healing systems to address the health challenges of the modern world. However, the path to integrating traditional medicine into mainstream global health is not without its complexities. It is a landscape filled with immense opportunities, yet fraught with significant challenges that must be carefully navigated.

One of the most significant challenges lies in the realm of standardization and regulation. Unlike modern medicine, which relies on rigorous, standardized clinical trials and a robust regulatory framework, traditional medicine is often characterized by a diversity of practices and a reliance on knowledge passed down through generations. This lack of uniformity can make it difficult to assess the safety and efficacy of traditional treatments in a systematic way. For traditional medicine to be widely accepted and integrated, there is a pressing need to develop appropriate regulatory models that respect the holistic and individualized nature of these practices while ensuring patient safety and quality control.

Another major hurdle is the risk of losing invaluable traditional knowledge. As societies modernize and natural habitats are degraded, the oral traditions and biodiversity that form the bedrock of many traditional systems are under threat. The commercialization of herbal medicine, for instance, can lead to the over-harvesting of certain plant species, endangering their survival and the ecosystems they inhabit. Furthermore, as younger generations migrate to urban centers, there is a risk that the intricate knowledge held by traditional healers will not be passed on. Preserving this heritage, both in terms of biological resources and cultural knowledge, is a critical task for the global community.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities for traditional medicine are vast. The growing demand for personalized and patient-centered care is a key driver of this trend. Many patients are drawn to traditional medicine’s holistic approach, which considers the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the individual. This contrasts with the often-fragmented nature of modern specialized medicine. The integration of traditional practices could lead to a more comprehensive and compassionate model of healthcare, one that empowers patients to take a more active role in their own healing journey.

Technological advancements are also opening up new frontiers for traditional medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analysis can be used to sift through vast amounts of traditional medical literature and clinical data, identifying patterns and potential new treatments that might otherwise be missed. Modern imaging techniques like fMRI can be used to study the physiological effects of practices like meditation and acupuncture, providing scientific validation for their therapeutic benefits. This synergy between ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology has the potential to unlock new and powerful approaches to health and wellness.

Looking ahead, the future of medicine is likely to be an integrative one, where the best of both traditional and modern systems are combined to provide the most effective care possible. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized this potential and is actively working to support member states in developing policies that foster the safe and effective integration of traditional medicine into their national health systems. The journey will require open-minded collaboration between traditional healers, modern medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers. By building bridges and fostering mutual respect, we can create a future where ancient wisdom and modern science work hand in hand to improve the health and well-being of all humanity.

**SECTION 2**

**(Music fades in and out)**

**Speaker:** Good morning and welcome to the Mindful Movement Centre. My name is David, and I'm the director here. I'm delighted to see so many new faces interested in exploring the powerful connection between mind and body. Our centre is dedicated to practices that cultivate inner peace and physical vitality, moving away from the high-intensity, often stressful, workout cultures you might find elsewhere. We focus on gentle, yet profound, traditional arts of movement and meditation.

Today, I want to introduce you to two of our core practices: Qigong and Tai Chi. Let's start with Qigong, which is often described as a form of meditative breathing exercise. However, it's more accurate to see it as a system of gentle, flowing movement that is coordinated with deep breathing and a calm, focused mind. The aim is to cultivate and balance 'Qi' or life energy.

One of our most popular classes is Tai Chi. While it has roots in martial arts, it is practiced today primarily as a health-promoting exercise. It's particularly beneficial for older adults, as numerous studies have shown it significantly improves balance, which in turn leads to a reduced risk of falls. The slow, deliberate movements also help to improve flexibility and reduce stress.

We offer several types of Qigong. For example, the 'Five Animals' Qigong is a dynamic and playful set where we imitate the spirit of the tiger, deer, bear, monkey, and crane. It’s a wonderful way to improve coordination and is suitable for all levels, not just advanced students. It’s designed to invigorate the body and mind.

For anyone new to our centre, we offer a complimentary group class so you can experience our approach firsthand before committing. We want you to feel comfortable and find the class that’s right for you.

Now, let me tell you about the specific benefits of some of our classes. Our 'Morning Flow Qigong' is designed to gently awaken the body and mind, leaving you with increased energy levels for the day ahead. If you're looking for a way to manage a hectic workday, our 'Midday Meditation' is perfect. It focuses entirely on calming the mind and is proven to be excellent for stress reduction. The 'Tai Chi for Balance' class, as the name suggests, is all about improving stability and preventing falls, but a key side benefit is the development of better posture. For those wanting something a bit more active, 'Dynamic Dragon Qigong' is a powerful sequence that really builds your core strength. Finally, our 'Evening Wind Down' class combines gentle stretches and breathing to release the tensions of the day, which greatly enhances concentration and prepares you for a restful night's sleep.

We hope you'll join us on this journey of wellness. Please feel free to ask any questions after my talk.

**SECTION 3**

**Dr. Evans:** Hi Chloe, Liam. Come in. So, let's talk about your dissertation proposals. Chloe, I had a look at your initial outline. You want to research the role of traditional medicine in modern society. It's a great topic, but the main problem is that it's far too broad. You need to narrow it down.

**Chloe:** Right, I was worried about that. I wasn’t sure where to start.

**Dr. Evans:** A good strategy is to focus on a specific country, or even a specific type of traditional medicine within that country. It will make your research much more manageable.

**Liam:** That’s what I’m trying to do. I’m focusing on China and the integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, into their hospital system. I’m particularly interested in its application for chronic disease management, things like arthritis or diabetes, rather than acute emergencies.

**Chloe:** That sounds interesting. I was thinking about India and Ayurveda. My main concern is data collection. I imagine there’s a lack of official statistics on how many people use these systems, which makes it hard to quantify.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a valid point, Chloe. You’ll likely need to rely more on qualitative methods – interviews, case studies. Liam, what have you found in your preliminary research on China?

**Liam:** It’s fascinating. My reading shows that acupuncture is often used alongside conventional cancer treatments to help manage side effects like nausea and pain. It’s not seen as a replacement, but as a complementary therapy. The level of integration is quite advanced.

**Dr. Evans:** Excellent. That’s a key point. For both of you, I’d advise you to include a section on the regulatory framework that governs these practices in your chosen country. It’s crucial for understanding the context.

**Chloe:** Okay, that’s helpful. I think for my next chapter, I’ll focus on patient perspectives and experiences. I want to understand *why* people choose Ayurvedic treatments.

**Liam:** I’m a bit worried about my own research. I need to conduct interviews, and I’m concerned about the potential for bias in my interview questions. I don’t want to lead the participants.

**Dr. Evans:** A common concern. We can work on formulating neutral questions in our next session. Also, I recommend you both look at the WHO’s global report on traditional medicine. It will give you a good overview of the worldwide prevalence of traditional medicine use and the key issues.

**Chloe:** Great, I’ll download that. So, what should we prepare for next week?

**Dr. Evans:** I want you both to go away and refine your topics based on our discussion. For your next supervision, you should submit a revised research plan and outline. That should include your main research questions and a chapter breakdown.

**Liam:** Okay, that’s clear. Thank you.

**Chloe:** Thanks, Dr. Evans.

**SECTION 4**

**Lecturer:** Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to discuss the globalization of traditional medicine. In recent decades, we’ve seen practices like acupuncture, herbalism, and Ayurveda move far beyond their cultural origins. This isn’t just a niche trend; it’s a global phenomenon, driven by factors like migration, the rapid spread of information online, and a growing consumer demand for more **holistic** healthcare options.

However, this globalization brings with it a host of complex challenges. The first and most critical is regulation and safety. In many countries, the market for traditional remedies is like the Wild West. There’s a huge variation in the standards for practitioners and for the products themselves. This creates a serious risk of incorrect or even dangerous **products** being sold to unsuspecting consumers. For example, there have been well-documented cases where a toxic herb has been misidentified and sold as a safe, common remedy, with tragic consequences.

Another major challenge is intellectual property. Traditional knowledge is often communal, developed over centuries by an entire community. It doesn’t fit neatly into Western legal frameworks of patents and ownership. This creates the risk of what’s known as 'biopiracy'. This is where corporations or researchers take traditional knowledge, patent it, and profit from it, often without any **compensation** or acknowledgement to the original communities. This not only feels unjust but can also prevent local people from benefiting from, or even using, their own cultural heritage.

Furthermore, we must consider sustainability. As a herb becomes popular on the global market, the demand can skyrocket. This can threaten the very **survival** of some medicinal plants due to over-harvesting. This, in turn, leads to a loss of biodiversity and the destruction of natural habitats. We urgently need to implement sustainable farming and wild-crafting practices to protect these precious resources.

But it’s not all challenges. The opportunities are immense. The integration of traditional and modern medicine can provide more treatment options, especially for chronic conditions where modern medicine may have limitations. This requires mutual **respect** between traditional healers and modern medical doctors, a partnership that is slowly beginning to form.

Technology also has a huge role to play. Mobile apps and websites can help to **educate** consumers about the safe and appropriate use of traditional remedies. Digital databases are being created to document and preserve traditional knowledge that might otherwise be lost. And cutting-edge science, using tools like AI, can analyze traditional formulas to identify new **active** compounds, potentially leading to the development of new drugs.

Finally, there are significant economic and cultural benefits. The global market for traditional medicine is a major source of **income** for many communities. And just as importantly, preserving these medical systems helps to maintain cultural identity and **heritage** in a rapidly globalizing world.

In conclusion, the globalization of traditional medicine is a double-edged sword. It requires a delicate **balance** between promoting access to these valuable healing systems and ensuring they are safe, sustainable, and used equitably. The ultimate goal is to build a truly integrative global health system that is respectful of both ancient wisdom and modern science.

## TUTOR GUIDE

**MODEL ANSWER FOR WRITING TASK 1**

The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the population that reportedly uses traditional medicine across five different global regions. Overall, the use of traditional medicine is significantly more prevalent in Africa and Asia compared to the other regions shown.

The highest reported usage is in Africa, where a substantial 80% of the population relies on traditional forms of medicine. Asia follows closely behind, with a figure of 75%. These two regions stand in stark contrast to the others, indicating a deep cultural integration and reliance on these practices for primary healthcare.

In the middle of the range is the average for middle-income countries, where 45% of the population uses traditional medicine. This figure is considerably lower than in Africa and Asia but more than double the usage reported in Europe and India.

Europe and India show the lowest percentages of the five regions, with very similar figures of 20% and 19% respectively. The low percentage in India is particularly noteworthy, given the country's rich history of traditional systems like Ayurveda, suggesting a strong presence of modern medicine or that usage is concentrated in specific demographics not captured by this data.

In summary, the data reveals a clear geographical divide in the use of traditional medicine, with its role being far more central in the healthcare systems of African and Asian nations than in European or other middle-income countries.

**MODEL ESSAY FOR WRITING TASK 2 (BAND 9)**

The debate over the role of traditional medicine in the 21st century is both complex and polarized. While proponents advocate for its full integration into modern healthcare systems, citing its holistic approach and long history, opponents raise valid concerns about a lack of scientific evidence and potential safety issues. A careful examination of both perspectives suggests that a collaborative, rather than fully integrated or entirely separate, approach is the most sensible path forward.

On the one hand, the argument for integration is compelling. Traditional systems, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda, have served vast populations for millennia. They often adopt a holistic philosophy, treating the patient as a whole person rather than just a collection of symptoms. This patient-centered approach is something modern medicine is increasingly trying to emulate. Furthermore, as scientific research has shown, traditional knowledge has been the source of numerous modern drugs, from aspirin to artemisinin. To dismiss this vast repository of knowledge as entirely unscientific would be to ignore its historical contribution and future potential. Integrating these practices could provide patients with more therapeutic options, particularly for chronic conditions where modern medicine may offer management rather than a cure.

On the other hand, the argument for separation is grounded in the principles of safety and efficacy. Modern medicine relies on a rigorous system of randomized controlled trials to prove that a treatment is both safe and effective. Many traditional remedies have not been subjected to this level of scrutiny, and their mechanisms are often poorly understood from a biomedical perspective. This lack of evidence raises legitimate concerns about patient safety, potential drug interactions, and the risk of patients choosing unproven therapies over life-saving conventional treatments. Keeping the systems separate, opponents argue, protects patients and upholds the scientific integrity of the healthcare system.

In my opinion, neither complete integration nor total separation is the optimal solution. The most pragmatic approach is one of respectful collaboration and evidence-based integration. This would involve investing in rigorous scientific research to validate the safety and efficacy of traditional treatments. Where evidence is strong, as is the case with acupuncture for certain types of pain, these therapies can be incorporated into mainstream care as complementary options. Simultaneously, robust regulation is essential to ensure the quality of herbal products and the competence of practitioners. By scientifically exploring traditional medicine, we can harness its potential benefits while safeguarding patients, creating a healthcare system that is truly the best of both worlds.

**SPEAKING PART 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE**

I can clearly recall a time a few years ago when my grandmother used a traditional remedy for a persistent cough I had. I’d been suffering from a dry, irritating cough for over a week. It wasn’t serious enough to see a doctor, but it was disrupting my sleep and was very annoying. I had tried over-the-counter cough syrups, but they didn’t seem to be having much effect.

Seeing my frustration, my grandmother decided to make me a traditional remedy that she had learned from her own mother. The treatment was a homemade syrup made from honey, lemon, and ginger. She meticulously grated the ginger, squeezed fresh lemon juice, and mixed it all with a generous amount of local, raw honey. She told me to take one spoonful of this mixture three times a day.

The result was surprisingly effective. Within a day, I noticed the irritation in my throat had subsided, and the coughing fits became less frequent. After about three days of consistently taking the syrup, my cough was almost completely gone. It worked much better than the chemical-laden syrup I had bought from the pharmacy.

I felt a real sense of comfort and care from the experience. It wasn’t just about the remedy itself, but the act of my grandmother preparing it for me. It felt more personal and holistic than simply taking a pill. While I understand the importance of modern medicine, this experience made me appreciate that there is a great deal of wisdom in these simple, age-old remedies, especially for minor ailments. It showed me that traditional and modern approaches don’t have to be in opposition; they can both have their place.
