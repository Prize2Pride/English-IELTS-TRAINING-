**The Invention of Race**

The concept of race, as we understand it today, is a relatively modern invention. While prejudice and conflict between different groups of people have existed for millennia, the classification of humans into distinct racial categories is a product of the early modern era, emerging in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This period of European exploration and colonialism necessitated a framework to justify the exploitation and subjugation of indigenous populations. The creation of racial hierarchies, which positioned Europeans at the apex, provided a powerful rationale for imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade.

Prior to this, in the ancient and medieval worlds, people were generally identified by their geographical origins. An individual from Africa would have been known as an “Ethiopian” or an “Egyptian,” not as “Black.” The shift towards a racialized worldview, one that emphasized skin color and other physical characteristics, gained momentum in the 17th century. The very word “race,” with its origins obscure, began to be used to denote these newly conceived biological groupings. It was in 1684 that the French physician and traveler François Bernier first used the term to categorize people based on their physical traits, a classification that would, in time, become tragically widespread.

Religion played a significant role in the early justification of racial discrimination. As European powers began the enslavement of Africans, religious doctrines were manipulated to sanction these brutal practices. In 1442, Pope Eugene IV offered absolution to Portuguese sailors who captured and sold Africans, and a decade later, Pope Nicholas V gave his blessing to the enslavement of “pagans.” This religious endorsement of slavery was not limited to Africans; Christopher Columbus, in his writings, used similar justifications for the enslavement of Native Americans. The Bible itself was contorted to support the notion of a racial hierarchy, with the story of Noah’s curse on his grandson Canaan being interpreted as a divine condemnation of all Black people to a life of servitude.

Alongside religious justifications, cultural arguments were also employed to legitimize racial oppression. The concept of the “White man’s burden” emerged, proposing that Europeans had a moral duty to impose their supposedly superior culture on other, “less civilized” races. This paternalistic and ethnocentric viewpoint portrayed indigenous peoples as savages who could only be “saved” through exposure to European culture. This ideology, which conveniently ignored the rich and complex civilizations of non-European peoples, was a cornerstone of colonial expansion and the brutal realities of slavery.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the rise of “scientific racism,” a pseudoscientific movement that sought to provide an empirical basis for racial hierarchies. Proponents of scientific racism used flawed methodologies and biased interpretations of data to argue that certain races were inherently superior to others. Social Darwinism, a particularly pernicious offshoot of this movement, misapplied Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution to human societies, claiming that the dominance of white Europeans was a natural and inevitable outcome of evolutionary progress. These pseudoscientific theories, presented with the authority of science, had a devastating impact, lending a veneer of intellectual respectability to racist ideologies and practices.

Even after the abolition of slavery and the decline of colonialism, the legacy of these invented racial hierarchies continues to shape our world. The concept of institutional or systemic racism describes how racial inequality has become embedded in the very fabric of our societies, in our laws, our institutions, and our social structures. This form of racism is often more insidious than individual prejudice, as it can persist even in the absence of overt racist intent. Understanding the historical construction of race is a crucial step in dismantling these enduring systems of discrimination and building a more just and equitable world.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**Discrimination in the Modern Workplace**

**A**
While the overt and legally sanctioned racism of the past has been largely dismantled, discrimination continues to be a persistent and pervasive issue in the modern workplace. Contemporary forms of discrimination are often more subtle and covert, making them difficult to identify and address. This insidious nature of modern racism poses significant challenges for both individuals and organizations striving to create truly equitable work environments. Unlike the blatant segregation and explicit discriminatory policies of previous eras, today’s workplace discrimination often manifests in nuanced ways, such as microaggressions, biased hiring and promotion practices, and unequal pay.

**B**
One of the most significant challenges in combating modern workplace discrimination is the difficulty in its measurement. While overt acts of racism are relatively easy to identify, the more subtle forms of discrimination are often hard to prove. Research in the sociology of discrimination has developed various methods to study this phenomenon. One approach is through the analysis of perceptual data, where individuals from minority groups are surveyed about their experiences with discrimination. These studies consistently show that a significant percentage of minority employees feel they have been unfairly treated because of their race. While these perceptions are a valuable source of information, they can be subjective and may not always correspond to the actual incidence of discrimination.

**C**
Another method for studying workplace discrimination is through reports from potential discriminators, such as employers and hiring managers. While direct questions about discriminatory practices are unlikely to yield honest answers, researchers have developed more subtle techniques to gauge racial bias. For example, employers might be asked about their preferences for certain types of workers or their perceptions of the skills and work ethic of different racial groups. These studies often reveal unconscious biases that can influence hiring and promotion decisions, even in the absence of overt racist intent.

**D**
Field experiments, or audit studies, provide some of the most compelling evidence of workplace discrimination. In a typical audit study, researchers send matched pairs of testers, one from a minority group and one from the majority group, to apply for the same jobs. The testers are given identical resumes and are trained to present themselves in a similar manner. By comparing the outcomes for the two groups of testers, researchers can directly measure the extent of discrimination in the hiring process. These studies have consistently found that minority candidates are less likely to be offered interviews or jobs than their white counterparts, even when they have identical qualifications.

**E**
Workplace harassment is another common form of racial discrimination. This can range from overt racial slurs and the display of offensive symbols to more subtle microaggressions, such as dismissive comments or the constant questioning of a minority employee’s competence. While isolated incidents of teasing or offhand comments may not be illegal, harassment becomes unlawful when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment. The harasser can be a supervisor, a coworker, or even a non-employee, such as a client or customer. The psychological impact of workplace harassment can be devastating, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and a diminished sense of self-worth.

**F**
Even seemingly neutral employment policies can have a discriminatory impact. An employment policy or practice that applies to all employees, regardless of race, can be illegal if it has a disproportionately negative effect on people of a particular race and is not job-related or necessary for the operation of the business. For example, a “no-beard” policy, while seemingly race-neutral, may be unlawful if it disproportionately harms the employment opportunities of Black men who have a predisposition to a skin condition that is exacerbated by shaving and is not a genuine requirement for the job.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Sociology and Psychology of Discrimination**

The persistence of racial inequality in modern society has led to a renewed focus on the role of discrimination. While overt prejudice and racism have declined, subtle and often unconscious biases continue to shape social interactions and create barriers to opportunity. The sociology of discrimination distinguishes between two main types of discrimination: differential treatment and disparate impact. Differential treatment refers to the unequal treatment of individuals based on their race, while disparate impact refers to policies or practices that are neutral on their face but have a discriminatory effect on a particular racial group. Understanding both of these forms of discrimination is essential for comprehending the complex ways in which racial inequality is maintained and reproduced.

One of the key challenges in studying discrimination is that it is often invisible to those who are not its targets. Perceptions of discrimination can vary significantly between different racial groups. Surveys consistently show that members of minority groups are far more likely to report experiencing discrimination than members of the majority group. This is not simply a matter of subjective interpretation; it reflects the different realities that people from different racial backgrounds inhabit. For those in the majority group, the world may appear to be a meritocracy, where success is determined by individual effort and talent. For those in minority groups, however, the world is often experienced as a place where race continues to matter, where they are judged not by the content of their character but by the color of their skin.

The psychological impacts of discrimination can be profound. Experiencing discrimination can lead to a range of negative mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The constant stress of navigating a world in which one is devalued and disrespected can take a heavy toll on an individual’s psychological well-being. Moreover, the experience of discrimination can lead to a phenomenon known as “stereotype threat,” in which the fear of confirming negative stereotypes about one’s group can actually impair performance on academic and other tasks. This creates a vicious cycle, in which the experience of discrimination leads to underperformance, which in turn reinforces the very stereotypes that gave rise to the discrimination in the first place.

While individual attitudes and behaviors are an important part of the story, a purely psychological approach to understanding discrimination is incomplete. A sociological perspective emphasizes the role of institutional and structural factors in perpetuating racial inequality. Institutional discrimination refers to the policies and practices of social institutions, such as schools, businesses, and the criminal justice system, that systematically disadvantage a particular racial group. For example, a school’s reliance on standardized tests for admission may have a disparate impact on students from minority groups, who may have had less access to high-quality educational resources. Similarly, a company’s reliance on informal social networks for recruitment may exclude qualified minority candidates who are not part of those networks.

Structural discrimination refers to the ways in which the very organization of society can produce and reproduce racial inequality. This includes the historical legacy of slavery and segregation, which has created a deeply entrenched system of racial hierarchy. It also includes the ways in which different forms of inequality, such as racial and economic inequality, can intersect and reinforce one another. For example, because of the historical legacy of discrimination, minority groups are more likely to live in poverty, which in turn limits their access to education, healthcare, and other opportunities. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of disadvantage that is difficult to break.

Addressing the complex and deeply rooted problem of racial discrimination requires a multi-faceted approach. It requires not only changing individual attitudes and behaviors but also transforming the institutions and structures that perpetuate racial inequality. This includes implementing policies that promote diversity and inclusion, investing in communities that have been historically disadvantaged, and challenging the ideologies of racism and white supremacy that continue to shape our world. It is only by addressing both the individual and the systemic dimensions of discrimination that we can hope to create a truly just and equitable society.

## LISTENING SCRIPTS

**SECTION 1**

**HR Manager:** Good morning, Sarah. Thanks for coming in. I understand you wanted to talk to me about an incident that happened last week.

**Sarah:** That’s right. I’m really not happy about it.

**HR Manager:** Okay, well, I’m here to listen. Can you tell me exactly what happened?

**Sarah:** It was on Wednesday afternoon, during the team meeting. Mark Jones started making some really offensive jokes about my background. He was making fun of my accent and my culture.

**HR Manager:** I see. And was this the first time something like this has happened?

**Sarah:** No, it’s been going on for a while. He’s made comments before, but this was the worst it’s ever been. He even used a racial slur.

**HR Manager:** I’m very sorry to hear that, Sarah. That is completely unacceptable. Was anyone else present when this happened?

**Sarah:** Yes, John Williams and Maria Garcia were both there. They looked really uncomfortable, but they didn’t say anything.

**HR Manager:** Okay. And what happened after the meeting?

**Sarah:** He tried to stop me from going to the training session that afternoon. He said I wasn’t smart enough to understand it.

**HR Manager:** This is a very serious matter, Sarah. I want to assure you that we will be taking this very seriously. Have you kept a record of these incidents?

**Sarah:** Yes, I’ve been keeping a diary of everything that’s happened.

**HR Manager:** That’s good. That will be very helpful. I’m going to launch a formal investigation into this matter. I’ll need to speak to Mark, John, and Maria. I’ll also need a copy of your diary.

**Sarah:** Okay.

**HR Manager:** I want to assure you that you have our full support. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of discrimination or harassment in this company. We will do everything we can to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.

**Sarah:** Thank you. I really appreciate that.

**SECTION 2**

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our workshop on unconscious bias. The aim of this workshop is not to point fingers or to make anyone feel guilty. Rather, it’s about raising our awareness of the unconscious biases that we all hold and how they can impact our decisions and interactions in the workplace. We all have biases. It’s a natural human tendency to categorize people based on our experiences and what we’ve been taught. The problem is that these biases can often be based on stereotypes and misinformation, and they can lead us to treat people unfairly, even when we don’t intend to.

One of the most common forms of unconscious bias is the microaggression. These are the small, everyday acts of discrimination that can be very hurtful and damaging. They can be verbal or non-verbal, and they are often unintentional. For example, asking a person of color where they are “really” from, or complimenting a female colleague on her appearance rather than her work. These may seem like small things, but they can have a cumulative effect, making people feel like they don’t belong.

During this workshop, we’re going to be doing a number of activities to help us explore our own unconscious biases. We’ll be starting with the Implicit Association Test, which is an online test that can help you to identify your own unconscious biases. It’s a real eye-opener, and I encourage you all to give it a go. We’ll also be doing some role-playing scenarios to help us understand how our biases can play out in real-life situations. This is a great way to develop empathy and to see things from a different perspective.

Later in the day, we’ll be looking at some case studies of how unconscious bias has affected real people in the workplace. This will help us to identify practical solutions for creating a more inclusive work environment. We’ll also be having some group discussions, which are a great opportunity to learn from the experiences of others. And finally, we’ll be asking you to do some personal reflection and to develop your own personal action plan for how you can challenge your own biases and promote a more inclusive culture in your team.

**SECTION 3**

**Dr. Evans:** Okay, so today we’re going to be discussing your research proposals. Chloe, do you want to start?

**Chloe:** Sure. My research project is on the impact of racial discrimination on mental health.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a very interesting topic. What have you found so far?

**Chloe:** Well, I’ve done a literature review, and there’s a lot of research that shows a strong link between discrimination and mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

**Ben:** That’s not surprising. I can imagine that experiencing discrimination on a regular basis would be incredibly stressful.

**Chloe:** Exactly. And it’s not just the major incidents of discrimination that have an impact. It’s also the everyday microaggressions that can wear people down over time.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a very important point. So, what’s your research question?

**Chloe:** I want to investigate the long-term effects of discrimination on mental health. I’m also interested in the role of resilience and social support in mitigating those effects.

**Ben:** That sounds really interesting. But how are you going to measure discrimination? It’s such a subjective experience.

**Chloe:** I know, that’s one of the challenges. I’m planning to use a combination of self-report questionnaires and in-depth interviews.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a good approach. But you need to be careful about the limitations of your study. For example, your sample size might be too small to draw any firm conclusions.

**Chloe:** I was thinking about that. I was also thinking about the concept of ‘intersectionality’. You know, the idea that different forms of discrimination can overlap and create unique experiences of disadvantage.

**Dr. Evans:** Yes, that’s a very important concept. You could, for example, look at the experiences of Black women, who may face discrimination on the basis of both their race and their gender.

**Ben:** I was reading a study the other day that found that discrimination can also have a physical impact. It can lead to things like high blood pressure and heart disease.

**Chloe:** Wow, I didn’t know that. That’s really shocking.

**Dr. Evans:** Yes, the mind-body connection is very powerful. I recommend you look at the work of Professor David Williams. He’s a psychologist who has done a lot of research on the health impacts of racism.

**Chloe:** Great, I’ll check him out. I’m a bit worried that my research is too focused on the negative aspects of discrimination. I don’t want it to be all doom and gloom.

**Ben:** You could also look at the positive side. You know, how people resist discrimination and build community.

**Dr. Evans:** That’s a great suggestion, Ben. You could look at the role of activism and social movements in challenging racism.

**Chloe:** That’s a really good idea. Thanks, guys. I feel much more confident about my project now. I’m going to refine my research question and methodology, and I’ll send you a revised proposal next week.

**SECTION 4**

Good morning, everyone. In today’s lecture, we’re going to be talking about racial discrimination and the law. Now, the concept of race, as we know it, is a relatively modern social construct. It was created to justify and maintain a system of racial hierarchy, in which some groups were seen as superior to others. And for centuries, the law was used to enforce this hierarchy. We can see this in the laws that sanctioned slavery, segregation, and apartheid.

However, the 20th century saw a major turning point in the fight against racial discrimination. The Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and similar movements around the world, challenged the legal basis of racism and led to the passage of landmark legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the US. This act outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

So, what do we mean by discrimination in a legal sense? Well, there are several different types. The most obvious is direct discrimination, which is when someone is treated less favourably because of their race. For example, refusing to hire someone because they are Black. But there is also indirect discrimination. This is when a rule or policy that applies to everyone has a disproportionate and negative impact on a particular racial group. For example, a requirement that all employees must be clean-shaven may indirectly discriminate against Sikh men who are required by their religion to wear a beard.

Then there is harassment, which is unwanted conduct related to race that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment. And finally, there is victimisation, which is when someone is treated badly because they have made a complaint of discrimination or have supported someone who has.

International law also has a crucial role to play in the fight against racial discrimination. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is a key international treaty that has been ratified by over 180 countries. It commits states to eliminating racial discrimination and promoting understanding among all races.

However, despite the progress that has been made, we still face significant challenges in the 21st century. We are seeing a rise in populism and xenophobia in many parts of the world. The persistence of systemic racism means that racial inequality is still a major problem. And we need to do more to address the intergenerational trauma of discrimination.

So, what is the future of anti-discrimination law? I believe that we need a more proactive and preventative approach. We need to move beyond simply responding to individual complaints and start to address the root causes of discrimination. This means tackling the stereotypes and prejudices that fuel racism. It also means ensuring the effective enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. We need to send a clear message that racism will not be tolerated in our societies.

## TUTOR GUIDE

**MODEL ANSWER FOR WRITING TASK 1**

The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people from five different ethnic groups who reported experiencing discrimination in the workplace in a particular European country in 2020.

Overall, the chart shows that people from minority ethnic groups were significantly more likely to report experiencing workplace discrimination than those from the white majority group. The highest percentage of reported discrimination was among Black people, while the lowest was among White people.

Just over a quarter of Black people (25%) reported experiencing discrimination at work, which was five times higher than the figure for White people (5%). The second highest percentage was for people of Asian ethnicity, at 18%, followed by people of mixed ethnicity, at 15%. The ‘Other’ ethnic group had the fourth highest percentage, with 12% of people reporting that they had faced discrimination in the workplace.

In summary, the chart reveals a clear disparity in the reported experiences of workplace discrimination between different ethnic groups, with Black and Asian people being the most likely to have faced this issue.

**MODEL ESSAY FOR WRITING TASK 2 (BAND 9 LEVEL)**

Racial discrimination remains a significant and pervasive issue in many societies around the world. While there is broad agreement that this problem must be addressed, there is less consensus on the most effective way to do so. Some people advocate for education as the primary tool for combating racism, while others argue that stricter laws and punishments are necessary. This essay will discuss both of these perspectives before offering a concluding opinion.

On the one hand, education has a crucial role to play in fostering a more tolerant and inclusive society. By teaching people about the history of racism, the value of diversity, and the importance of empathy, education can help to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that fuel discrimination. A well-designed educational curriculum can equip young people with the critical thinking skills they need to question racist ideologies and to recognise the humanity in all people, regardless of their background. Furthermore, education can promote intercultural understanding and dialogue, which can help to break down the barriers that divide us.

On the other hand, it is clear that education alone is not enough. The deeply entrenched nature of systemic racism requires a more robust response. Stronger laws and punishments are needed to send a clear message that discrimination will not be tolerated. This includes legislation that prohibits discrimination in all areas of life, from employment and housing to education and the criminal justice system. It also means ensuring that those who break these laws are held accountable for their actions. The deterrent effect of legal sanctions can be a powerful tool for changing behaviour and for creating a more just and equitable society.

In my view, a combination of both education and legal reform is needed to effectively address racial discrimination. Education can help to change hearts and minds, while laws can provide a framework for ensuring that everyone is treated with dignity and respect. These two approaches are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are mutually reinforcing. Education can help to create a culture in which discrimination is socially unacceptable, while laws can provide a mechanism for redress when it does occur. Ultimately, the goal must be to create a society in which everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential, free from the scourge of racism.


**SPEAKING PART 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE**

I’d like to talk about something I saw happen just a few months ago in my local library. I was there one afternoon, looking for a book, and it was quite busy. There was a young woman, who looked like she might have been a recent immigrant, trying to use the computer. She was clearly struggling and seemed quite distressed. She was trying to fill out some kind of online form, but she didn’t seem to have a very good grasp of English or how to use the computer.

An older man, who was sitting at the next computer, noticed her struggling. He was a white man, probably in his late 60s or early 70s. He leaned over and very gently asked her if she needed any help. She was a bit hesitant at first, but he had a very kind and reassuring manner, and she eventually nodded. He then spent the next twenty minutes patiently guiding her through the form, explaining what she needed to do in simple, clear language. He was so patient and kind, and he never once made her feel stupid or incompetent.

Watching this interaction made me feel really heartened. In a world where you hear so many negative stories about intolerance and prejudice, it was wonderful to see such a simple act of human kindness. It reminded me that most people are good and decent, and that we have more in common than we have that divides us. It was a small moment, but it had a big impact on me. It restored my faith in humanity a little bit, and it made me want to be a kinder and more helpful person myself.
