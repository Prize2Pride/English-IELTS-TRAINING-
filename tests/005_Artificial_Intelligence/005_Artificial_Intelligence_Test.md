**The Dawn of Artificial Intelligence**

The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) is not a product of the 21st century. It has roots that stretch back to antiquity, where myths and legends across various cultures featured artificial beings endowed with intelligence. From the bronze automaton Talos in Greek mythology to the Golems of Jewish folklore, the human fascination with creating intelligent entities is a tale as old as time. However, it was the formal study of logic and reasoning, pioneered by ancient philosophers, that laid the intellectual groundwork for the modern pursuit of AI. This journey from abstract thought to tangible technology culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine born from the principles of mathematical reasoning. This groundbreaking invention sparked a new wave of scientific inquiry, prompting researchers to seriously consider the possibility of constructing an “electronic brain.”

The year 1956 is often cited as the official birth of artificial intelligence as a formal academic discipline. This was the year of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, a workshop that brought together a group of visionary scientists who would become the pioneers of the field. The event was organized by John McCarthy, who is credited with coining the term “artificial intelligence,” along with Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon. The proposal for the workshop was ambitious, stating that “every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” The attendees, including future luminaries like Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, were optimistic, with many predicting that human-level machine intelligence was only a generation away. This optimism was infectious, and it attracted significant funding from the U.S. government, which was keen to support this futuristic vision.

The years following the Dartmouth workshop were a period of fervent research and notable successes. Early AI programs demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specific domains. For instance, the Logic Theorist, a program developed by Newell and Simon, was able to prove several theorems from Whitehead and Russell’s *Principia Mathematica*. Another program, the General Problem Solver, was designed to imitate human problem-solving methods. These early successes fueled the belief that the creation of general artificial intelligence was imminent. However, the initial euphoria began to wane as researchers grappled with the immense complexity of creating truly intelligent systems. The challenges of endowing machines with common sense, natural language understanding, and the ability to learn from experience proved to be far more formidable than initially anticipated.

The early optimism of the 1960s gave way to a period of disillusionment in the mid-1970s, now known as the “first AI winter.” The ambitious predictions of the previous decade had failed to materialize, and the limitations of existing AI technologies became increasingly apparent. A pivotal moment was the publication of the Lighthill Report in the UK in 1973, which was highly critical of the progress in AI research. The report, commissioned by the British government, concluded that AI had failed to achieve its grandiose objectives and recommended significant cuts in funding for AI research. A similar sentiment was echoed in the United States, where the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a major funder of AI research, began to divert its resources to more targeted and results-driven projects. This led to a significant reduction in funding for fundamental, long-term AI research, and the field entered a period of relative stagnation.

Despite the funding cuts and the prevailing skepticism, the first AI winter was not a complete freeze. Research continued in a more focused and pragmatic manner. The period saw the rise of expert systems, a new type of AI program that captured the knowledge of human experts in a specific domain to solve complex problems. These systems, while narrow in their application, proved to be commercially viable and demonstrated the practical value of AI. The success of expert systems helped to rekindle interest in AI and laid the groundwork for the next wave of innovation in the field. The first AI winter, therefore, was not an end but a necessary period of recalibration, a time when the field shed its initial naivety and began to mature into a more rigorous and realistic scientific discipline.

**READING PASSAGE 2**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 14-26**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

**The Two Faces of AI: Symbolic vs. Connectionist Approaches**

**A**
The field of artificial intelligence is not a monolith. Rather, it is a diverse discipline with a variety of approaches to creating intelligent systems. Historically, the development of AI has been dominated by two major paradigms: symbolic AI and connectionist AI. These two approaches represent fundamentally different philosophies about how to achieve machine intelligence. Symbolic AI, often referred to as “Good Old-Fashioned AI” (GOFAI), is based on the assumption that intelligence can be achieved by manipulating symbols according to a set of explicit rules. This approach was the dominant paradigm in the early days of AI, from the 1950s to the 1980s.

**B**
At the heart of symbolic AI is the belief that knowledge can be represented in a declarative, explicit form, such as a set of logical rules or a semantic network. Proponents of this approach argue that human cognition is essentially a process of symbol manipulation. When we reason, they contend, we are mentally manipulating symbols that represent concepts and ideas. Therefore, to create an intelligent machine, we need to build a system that can represent knowledge in a symbolic form and then apply a set of rules to reason about that knowledge. Expert systems, which were popular in the 1980s, are a prime example of the symbolic approach. These systems encoded the knowledge of human experts in a specific domain as a set of “if-then” rules, which the system could then use to make decisions or solve problems.

**C**
In stark contrast to the symbolic approach, connectionist AI, which gained prominence in the 1980s and has seen a major resurgence in recent years with the rise of deep learning, is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. The fundamental idea behind connectionism is that intelligence emerges from the interactions of a large number of simple processing units, or “neurons,” organized into a network. Unlike symbolic AI, where knowledge is represented explicitly, in a connectionist system, knowledge is stored implicitly in the strength of the connections, or “weights,” between the neurons. Learning in a connectionist system occurs by adjusting these weights based on experience.

**D**
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the most common implementation of the connectionist approach. These networks are composed of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that process information in a way that is analogous to the human brain. When an ANN is presented with a new piece of information, such as an image or a piece of text, the neurons in the network are activated in a particular pattern. The network then learns to associate this pattern of activation with a particular output, such as a label for the image or a translation of the text. This process of learning is typically achieved through a technique called backpropagation, which involves adjusting the weights of the connections in the network to minimize the difference between the network’s output and the desired output.

**E**
For a long time, the symbolic and connectionist approaches were seen as being in opposition to each other, with researchers in each camp often being highly critical of the other. Proponents of symbolic AI argued that connectionist models were black boxes, in that it was difficult to understand how they arrived at their conclusions. They also pointed out that connectionist models often required large amounts of data to learn effectively. On the other hand, proponents of connectionist AI argued that symbolic models were brittle and unable to cope with the ambiguity and noise that is inherent in real-world data. They also argued that symbolic models were not well-suited for tasks that involve perception, such as image recognition or speech recognition.

**F**
In recent years, however, there has been a growing recognition that the symbolic and connectionist approaches are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many researchers now believe that the future of AI lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches. These hybrid systems aim to combine the explicit knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of symbolic AI with the learning and pattern recognition capabilities of connectionist AI. For example, a hybrid system might use a neural network to process raw sensory data, such as an image, and then use a symbolic reasoner to make high-level decisions based on the output of the neural network. By combining the two approaches, researchers hope to create AI systems that are both powerful and transparent, capable of learning from experience while also being able to explain their reasoning.

**READING PASSAGE 3**

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 27-40**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

**The Ethical Maze of Artificial Intelligence**

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is no longer the stuff of science fiction; it is a present-day reality that is reshaping our world in profound ways. From the algorithms that curate our social media feeds to the sophisticated systems that are beginning to drive our cars, AI is becoming increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives. While the potential benefits of this technological revolution are immense, so too are the ethical challenges. As we delegate more and more decisions to intelligent machines, we are forced to confront a host of complex questions about fairness, accountability, privacy, and the very nature of what it means to be human.

One of the most pressing ethical concerns surrounding AI is the issue of bias. AI systems learn from the data they are trained on, and if that data reflects existing societal biases, the AI system will not only learn those biases but may also amplify them. For example, if a hiring algorithm is trained on historical data from a company that has predominantly hired men for technical roles, the algorithm may learn to discriminate against female applicants, even if the programmers did not intend for it to do so. This can lead to the perpetuation and even exacerbation of social inequalities, creating a vicious cycle of discrimination that is all the more insidious because it is hidden behind a veneer of algorithmic objectivity.

The question of accountability is another major ethical minefield. When an autonomous system, such as a self-driving car, makes a mistake that results in harm, who is to blame? Is it the owner of the car, the manufacturer, the programmer who wrote the code, or the AI itself? The traditional legal frameworks that we use to assign responsibility are ill-equipped to handle these new and complex scenarios. The “black box” nature of many advanced AI systems, particularly those based on deep learning, further complicates the issue. In many cases, it is impossible to fully understand how these systems arrive at their decisions, making it difficult to identify the source of an error and to hold anyone accountable.

Privacy is another fundamental right that is being challenged by the rise of AI. The proliferation of AI-powered surveillance technologies, from facial recognition systems to the analysis of our online behavior, is creating a world in which our every move can be tracked, monitored, and analyzed. While these technologies can be used for legitimate purposes, such as law enforcement and public safety, they also have the potential to be used for more nefarious ends, such as social control and political manipulation. The collection and analysis of vast amounts of personal data also raises serious questions about data ownership and consent. Who owns the data that we generate, and how can we ensure that it is being used in a way that is consistent with our values and interests?

Perhaps the most profound ethical challenge posed by AI is the question of what it means to be human in an age of intelligent machines. As AI systems become more and more capable, they will begin to take on tasks that were once the exclusive domain of humans, from creative endeavors like writing and art to complex decision-making in fields like medicine and law. This raises fundamental questions about the future of work and the role of humans in a world where machines can do many of the things that we currently do. It also forces us to confront the possibility of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would be as intelligent as a human in all aspects. The creation of AGI would be a transformative event in human history, and it is one that we must approach with extreme caution and a deep sense of responsibility.

**SECTION 2**

**(Sound of a lecture hall, gentle chatter)**

**Lecturer:** Good morning, everyone. Welcome to this introductory talk on the role of artificial intelligence in education. In the next few minutes, we'll be exploring how AI is set to transform the way we learn and teach. Now, when we talk about AI in education, we're not talking about robots replacing teachers. Instead, we're looking at how AI can be used as a powerful tool to support educators and create more **personalized learning experiences** for students. (11)

One of the most significant benefits of AI in the classroom is its ability to **automate administrative tasks for teachers**. (12) Think about the amount of time teachers spend on grading, paperwork, and other administrative duties. By automating these tasks, AI can free up teachers to focus on what they do best: teaching and interacting with their students.

Another exciting application of AI in education is the development of AI-powered tutors. These tutors can provide students with **instant feedback and support**, 24 hours a day. (13) If a student is struggling with a particular concept, the AI tutor can provide them with additional explanations, examples, and practice exercises until they master the material.

Of course, the integration of AI in education is not without its challenges. One of the main concerns is the potential for a **lack of human interaction**. (14) While AI tutors can be incredibly helpful, they cannot replace the empathy, encouragement, and mentorship that a human teacher can provide. It is crucial that we find the right balance between the use of technology and the importance of human connection in the learning process.

Ultimately, I believe that the future of AI in education will depend on **how well it is integrated into the curriculum**. (15) It's not enough to simply have the technology; we need to think carefully about how we can use it to enhance the learning experience and to achieve our educational goals. It's a tool, and like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how we use it.

Now, let's look at some specific applications of AI in education. First, automated essay grading. I am **cautious about its implementation**. (16) While it can be a useful tool for providing quick feedback, I worry that it may not be able to appreciate the nuances of human writing. Next, personalized learning paths. I am **optimistic about its potential**. (17) The ability to tailor the curriculum to the individual needs of each student is a game-changer. Then we have AI-powered virtual reality field trips. I am also **optimistic about its potential**. (18) This could open up a world of possibilities for students, allowing them to visit places they would never be able to go to in person. What about AI-based student monitoring systems? I am **cautious about its implementation**. (19) We need to be very careful about the privacy implications of such systems. Finally, AI tutors for every student. I am **optimistic about its potential**. (20) This could be a major step towards democratizing education and providing every student with the support they need to succeed.

**SECTION 3**

**(Sound of a radio studio, gentle intro music)**

**Interviewer:** Welcome back to “Science Today.” This week, we’re discussing the growing role of artificial intelligence in medicine. With me in the studio are Dr. Anna Evans, a leading AI researcher, and Dr. Ben Chen, a practicing physician. Welcome to you both.

**Dr. Evans & Dr. Chen:** Thank you for having us.

**Interviewer:** So, Dr. Evans, let's start with you. What are the main benefits of using AI in **medical diagnosis**? (21)

**Dr. Evans:** Well, one of the key advantages is the ability of AI to **analyze a large amount of data very quickly**. (22) An AI system can review thousands of medical images, like X-rays or MRIs, in a fraction of the time it would take a human radiologist. This can lead to faster and more accurate diagnoses.

**Interviewer:** Dr. Chen, as a physician, what are your thoughts on this? Are you concerned about the rise of AI in your field?

**Dr. Chen:** I am optimistic, but also cautious. While I agree that AI has the potential to be a powerful tool, I am concerned about the risk of a **loss of the human touch in healthcare**. (23) A diagnosis is not just about interpreting data; it's also about understanding the patient's history, their concerns, and their emotional state. An AI can't do that.

**Dr. Evans:** I agree that the human element is crucial. I don't see AI as a replacement for doctors, but rather as a tool to augment their abilities. The role of doctors will evolve. They will need to **develop new skills**, such as the ability to interpret and validate the output of AI systems. (24)

**Interviewer:** That brings us to the “black box” problem. Dr. Chen, can you explain what that is?

**Dr. Chen:** Certainly. The “black box” problem refers to the fact that with some complex AI models, it's difficult to understand **how the AI reaches its conclusions**. (25) This lack of transparency is a major concern in medicine, where the stakes are so high. If we don't know why an AI has made a particular diagnosis, how can we trust it?

**Dr. Evans:** That's a valid point. However, there is a lot of research being done on this issue. We are **developing new methods for interpreting AI decisions**, to make them more transparent and understandable to doctors. (26)

**Interviewer:** What about the use of AI for diagnosing rare diseases? Dr. Chen?

**Dr. Chen:** I think it has the **potential to be very helpful**. (27) A human doctor may only see a handful of cases of a rare disease in their entire career, but an AI can be trained on data from thousands of cases from all over the world. This could significantly improve our ability to diagnose these conditions.

**Dr. Evans:** Exactly. A great example is an AI system that was developed to detect diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness. The AI was found to be **more accurate than human ophthalmologists** in diagnosing the condition. (28) This shows the power of AI to assist doctors and improve patient outcomes.

**Dr. Chen:** While I find that impressive, I am still worried that the increasing reliance on AI in medicine could **create new ethical problems**. (29) For example, if an AI makes a mistake, who is liable? The doctor, the hospital, or the company that developed the AI? These are complex questions that we need to address.

**Interviewer:** It seems clear that this is a complex issue with both great promise and significant challenges. To wrap up, what is the one thing you both agree on?

**Dr. Evans:** I think we both agree that the **integration of AI in medicine requires careful consideration**. (30) It's not a magic bullet, but it is a powerful tool that has the potential to revolutionize healthcare.

**Dr. Chen:** I concur. We need to proceed with a combination of optimism and caution.

**SECTION 4**

**(Sound of a lecture, a professor speaking)**

**Professor:** Good morning. In today's lecture, we're going to be looking at the future of artificial intelligence and robotics, and the profound impact they are likely to have on our society. I would argue that we are on the cusp of a new **industrial** revolution, one that will be driven by the twin forces of AI and automation. (31)

Let's start with the impact on employment. There is no doubt that many jobs will be automated in the coming years, particularly those that are **routine** and repetitive. (32) Think about jobs in manufacturing, data entry, and even some areas of transportation. However, it is not all doom and gloom. Just as the first Industrial Revolution created new jobs that were unimaginable at the time, so too will this new revolution. We will see a growing demand for people to work in AI development, **robotics**, and maintenance. (33) The key will be for humans to focus on developing skills that are difficult to automate, such as creativity, critical thinking, and **emotional** intelligence. (34)

Now, let's turn to the social and ethical implications. The rise of AI and robotics raises a number of serious concerns. There are fears about the potential for **mass surveillance** and the loss of human autonomy. (35) The development of autonomous weapons, or “killer robots,” also raises serious **ethical** questions. (36) We need to have a global conversation about how to regulate these technologies to ensure that they are used for the benefit of humanity, not for its destruction. We also need to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared **fairly** across society, to avoid a future where we have a small class of super-rich AI owners and a large class of unemployed people. (37)

Finally, let's consider the future of human-robot interaction. As robots become more intelligent and capable, they will become more integrated into our daily lives. They will act as personal assistants, companions, and even **caregivers**. (38) The development of social robots, robots that can interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way, will require a deeper understanding of human **psychology** and emotions. (39) The ultimate goal is to create a future where humans and robots can **collaborate** effectively, with each complementing the strengths of the other. (40) This is not a future to be feared, but one to be embraced, as long as we approach it with wisdom and foresight.

## TUTOR GUIDE

### WRITING TASK 1: MODEL ANSWER

The provided bar chart illustrates the global investment in artificial intelligence from 2018 to 2024, with projections extending to 2030. The investment figures are presented in billions of U.S. dollars.

Overall, the chart indicates a consistent and significant upward trend in global AI investment over the period shown, with this growth expected to accelerate in the coming years. The initial investment in 2018 was relatively modest, standing at approximately $50 billion. This figure saw a steady increase, doubling to around $100 billion by 2020 and continuing to climb to just under $200 billion by 2022.

By 2024, the investment is shown to have reached approximately $250 billion. The projections for the future suggest a dramatic surge in funding for artificial intelligence. It is anticipated that investment will reach $350 billion by 2026 and continue to rise sharply to $450 billion by 2028. The most striking feature of the chart is the projected leap to $500 billion in global AI investment by the year 2030, a tenfold increase from the 2018 figure. This demonstrates the rapidly growing financial commitment to the development and application of artificial intelligence worldwide.

### WRITING TASK 2: MODEL ESSAY (BAND 9)

The proliferation of artificial intelligence has sparked a fervent debate about its ultimate trajectory and impact on humanity. One school of thought posits that AI will inevitably surpass human intelligence, potentially becoming an uncontrollable existential threat. Conversely, a more optimistic viewpoint regards AI as a perpetually subservient tool, destined to unlock unprecedented benefits for society. This essay will explore both perspectives before arguing that while the potential risks of advanced AI are significant and warrant careful consideration, its development as a controllable and beneficial tool is the more probable outcome.

On the one hand, the apprehension surrounding the rise of superintelligent AI is not without merit. The concept of an “intelligence explosion,” where a self-improving AI rapidly exceeds human cognitive abilities, is a recurring theme in both science fiction and academic discourse. Proponents of this view argue that an entity with such a profound intellectual advantage could have goals that are misaligned with human values, leading to catastrophic consequences. The difficulty of programming a truly benevolent and infallible set of ethics into an AI, often referred to as the “alignment problem,” is a formidable challenge. Furthermore, the increasing autonomy of AI systems in critical domains such as defense and finance raises legitimate concerns about the potential for unintended and irreversible actions.

On the other hand, the argument that AI will remain a tool under human control is compelling. Throughout history, humanity has a track record of developing and managing powerful technologies, from nuclear energy to genetic engineering. The development of AI is no different. The vast majority of current AI research is focused on creating specialized, or “narrow,” AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. These systems are not conscious, nor do they possess the general intelligence required for independent thought or action. Moreover, the global community is becoming increasingly aware of the need for robust ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to govern the development and deployment of AI. International collaborations and public-private partnerships are being formed to ensure that AI is developed in a safe, transparent, and accountable manner.

In my opinion, while the dystopian scenarios of rogue AI are captivating, they are also speculative. The more immediate and tangible reality is that AI is already providing immense benefits to society, from revolutionizing medical diagnosis to optimizing energy consumption. The key to harnessing the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks lies in a proactive and collaborative approach to its governance. By investing in safety research, promoting transparency, and fostering a global dialogue about the ethical implications of AI, we can steer its development in a direction that is aligned with our collective values and interests. Therefore, I believe that with prudent management, AI will continue to be a powerful tool for human progress, rather than a threat to our existence.

### SPEAKING PART 2: SAMPLE RESPONSE

I’d like to talk about a time I used a navigation app on my phone, which is a great example of an everyday application of artificial intelligence. This was just last weekend, when I was driving to a friend’s wedding in a part of the country I’d never been to before. The reception was being held at a remote countryside hotel, and I was a bit worried about getting lost.

I used Google Maps on my smartphone. As soon as I typed in the address of the hotel, the app instantly calculated the best route for me. What I find amazing is how it uses AI to do this. It doesn’t just give you the shortest route; it analyzes real-time traffic data to find the fastest one. It can predict traffic jams and suggest alternative routes to avoid them. During my journey, there was an unexpected road closure due to an accident, and the app immediately rerouted me, saving me a lot of time and stress.

I felt incredibly relieved and grateful for having this technology at my fingertips. It took all the anxiety out of the journey and allowed me to relax and enjoy the drive. It’s like having a personal navigator who knows everything about the roads and traffic conditions. It made me realize how much I rely on AI in my daily life without even thinking about it. It’s a powerful tool that can make our lives so much easier and more efficient.
