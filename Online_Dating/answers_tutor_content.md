### **Writing Task 1 (General Training): Model Answer & Analysis**

**Model Answer (Band 9)**

Hi [Friend's Name],

Hope you’re doing well. I’m writing because I have some exciting news and I thought of you. You know I’ve been single for a while and was getting a bit tired of not meeting anyone new. So, on a whim, I decided to download a dating app last month, mostly out of curiosity.

Well, you won’t believe it, but I met someone really special! His name is Tom, and he’s a graphic designer. He’s incredibly kind, has a fantastic sense of humour, and we have so much in common, including our love for old movies and hiking. We had our first date last week and we talked for hours. It felt so natural and easy.

I know you’ve been thinking about trying it, and I honestly think you should. My advice would be to choose photos that really show your personality and to be honest in your profile. Also, just be patient and don’t take it too seriously at first. It’s a great way to meet people you wouldn’t normally cross paths with. Let me know if you decide to go for it!

Best,

[Your Name]

**Analysis:**
*   **Task Achievement:** Fully addresses all three bullet points.
*   **Tone:** The tone is informal and friendly, which is appropriate for an email to a friend.
*   **Structure:** The email is well-structured, with each paragraph addressing a different part of the prompt.
*   **Vocabulary:** Uses natural, appropriate language (e.g., *on a whim, out of curiosity, fantastic sense of humour, cross paths with*).

### **Writing Task 2: Model Essay (Band 9)**

**Model Essay**

The proliferation of dating applications has fundamentally altered the way people search for romantic partners. While these platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for connection, they also attract significant criticism regarding their impact on relationships and society. This essay will discuss both the positive and negative aspects of this trend before concluding that, despite their flaws, dating apps are a largely positive development in modern society.

On the one hand, critics argue that online dating fosters a superficial and disposable approach to relationships. The ‘swipe’ mechanism, which is central to many apps, encourages users to make snap judgments based on a few photographs, reducing individuals to commodities in a digital marketplace. This can lead to the “paradox of choice,” where an abundance of options makes it harder to commit to one person, promoting a culture of transient and meaningless connections. Furthermore, issues such as ‘ghosting’—where individuals cease communication without explanation—can have a detrimental effect on users’ self-esteem and mental well-being.

On the other hand, dating apps provide significant benefits. Their primary advantage is efficiency and access. They offer a practical solution for individuals with busy careers or limited social circles to meet a wide range of people they would otherwise never encounter. Moreover, research has shown that online dating has contributed to a more integrated society. A study from Stanford University, for instance, found a dramatic increase in interracial marriages and relationships between people from different social backgrounds, a trend largely attributed to the rise of online dating platforms that break down traditional social and geographical barriers.

In my opinion, the advantages of online dating ultimately outweigh the disadvantages. While the problems of superficiality and rejection are real, they are not unique to online dating; similar challenges have always existed in the search for a partner. The key difference is that these platforms provide a level of access and opportunity that was previously unimaginable. They empower individuals to take control of their romantic lives and connect with a diverse pool of people. The solution to the negative aspects is not to reject the technology, but for users to approach it with mindfulness, honesty, and resilience.

In conclusion, while the concerns about the negative impacts of dating apps on society are valid, their role in creating connections and fostering a more diverse social fabric is a powerful counter-argument. They are a tool, and like any tool, their effect depends on how they are used.

**Examiner Tips:**
*   **Discuss Both Views:** The essay clearly dedicates a paragraph to the negative view and another to the positive view.
*   **Give a Clear Opinion:** The author’s opinion is stated in the introduction and developed in the third body paragraph and conclusion.
*   **Use of Evidence:** Mentions a real study (Stanford) to add weight to the argument.
*   **Cohesive Devices:** Uses a range of linking phrases to ensure the essay flows smoothly (e.g., *On the one hand, Furthermore, On the other hand, Moreover, In my opinion*).
