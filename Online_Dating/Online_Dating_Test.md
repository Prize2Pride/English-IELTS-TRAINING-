### The Algorithm of Attraction

In the past, finding a romantic partner often depended on social circles, chance encounters, or introductions from friends and family. Today, the landscape of love has been dramatically reshaped by technology. Online dating, once a niche activity surrounded by stigma, has become a mainstream and socially accepted way to meet potential partners. At the heart of this revolution are the complex algorithms that power dating apps and websites, silently working behind the scenes to suggest who we might find attractive.

These algorithms function as digital matchmakers. When a user creates a profile, they provide a wealth of data, from basic demographics like age and location to more personal details about their hobbies, education, political views, and what they are looking for in a relationship. This information forms the initial dataset. The algorithm then uses this data to identify and suggest other users who have compatible profiles. For example, if a user expresses an interest in hiking and classical music, the system will prioritise showing them other users who share these passions.

However, the matching process goes far beyond simple keyword filtering. Modern dating platforms employ sophisticated machine learning models that learn from user behaviour. Every swipe, message, and interaction is a new data point that feeds back into the system. If a user consistently shows interest in profiles of a certain type—for instance, people who have travelled extensively—the algorithm will learn this preference and adjust future recommendations accordingly. This is known as collaborative filtering, where the system makes predictions about a user's interests by collecting preferences from many other users. It assumes that if person A has the same opinion as person B on one issue, they are more likely to have the same opinion on another.

Furthermore, some platforms use even more advanced techniques, such as analysing language patterns in user bios and messages to gauge personality traits. For example, the use of positive, optimistic language might be identified as a desirable trait and used to match individuals with similar communication styles. Some apps have even experimented with facial recognition technology to analyse the physical features of people a user finds attractive, although this practice has raised significant privacy concerns.

Despite the technological sophistication, the effectiveness of these algorithms is a subject of ongoing debate. Critics argue that human attraction is far too complex and nuanced to be predicted by a computer. They suggest that the chemistry and spark that ignite a real-world connection cannot be quantified in a dataset. Moreover, there is a risk that these algorithms may create "echo chambers," where users are only shown profiles of people who are very similar to them, potentially limiting their exposure to a diverse range of partners. While technology has undoubtedly made it easier to meet more people, the magic of finding a true connection may still lie beyond the reach of any algorithm.

## Reading Passage 2

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 11–20**, which are based on Reading Passage 2 below.

### Crafting the Perfect Profile: The New First Impression

In the world of online dating, your profile is your digital handshake, your opening line, and your first impression all rolled into one. It is the single most important tool you have to attract a potential partner. While it may seem like a simple task, crafting a profile that is both authentic and appealing is an art form. It requires a careful balance of showcasing your best qualities without appearing arrogant, and being honest without oversharing. Experts in digital communication and relationship psychology have identified several key elements that contribute to a successful online dating profile.

**A. The Primacy of the Photograph**

Before a single word of your bio is read, a potential match will see your photos. Research consistently shows that profiles with high-quality, clear photographs receive significantly more attention. The ideal photo selection should include a variety of shots. A clear, smiling headshot should be your primary picture. This should be supplemented with photos that reveal more about your personality and lifestyle—a picture of you hiking, a shot of you with friends (but not as the main profile picture), or one with a beloved pet. The goal is to paint a picture of a well-rounded, approachable individual. Avoid using old or heavily edited photos, as this can create a sense of mistrust when you eventually meet in person.

**B. The Bio: More Than Just Words**

While photos provide the initial attraction, the biography (or 'bio') is where a deeper connection begins. A common mistake is to simply list adjectives like "fun, kind, and adventurous." A more effective approach is to 'show, don't tell'. Instead of saying you are adventurous, describe a recent adventure: "I recently went kayaking for the first time and loved it, even though I fell in twice!" This creates a more engaging and memorable narrative. The bio should be positive and concise. A long, rambling essay can be off-putting. Aim for a tone that is light-hearted and open, and end with a question or a 'call to action' to make it easier for someone to start a conversation, such as, "What's the best concert you've ever been to?"

**C. The Pitfall of Clichés**

Many dating profiles are filled with the same tired clichés: "I'm looking for my partner in crime," "I love to laugh," or "I enjoy long walks on the beach." While these sentiments may be true, they are so overused that they become meaningless and make a profile blend in with the crowd. To stand out, be specific. Instead of saying you love to travel, mention a specific place you loved and why. Instead of saying you have a "good sense of humour," tell a short, appropriate joke or a funny one-liner. Originality is key to capturing someone's attention.

**D. Honesty as a Strategy**

It can be tempting to exaggerate or omit certain details to make a profile seem more perfect. However, experts agree that honesty is the best policy in the long run. Misrepresenting your height, age, or interests will only lead to an awkward and disappointing first date. Being upfront about what you are looking for—whether it's a serious relationship or something more casual—is also crucial. This transparency helps to filter out incompatible matches from the beginning, saving both time and emotional energy. An authentic profile will attract people who are genuinely interested in the real you, which is the foundation of any successful relationship.

The profile's bio is where a more profound **16** _______________ can be formed. Instead of just listing adjectives, it is better to 'show, don't tell' by describing a personal **17** _______________. It is also a good idea to end the bio with a question to encourage conversation.

## Reading Passage 3

You should spend about 20 minutes on **Questions 21–30**, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.

### The Social Impact of a Swipe-Right World

The rise of online dating has been one of the most significant social transformations of the 21st century. In less than two decades, it has evolved from a fringe activity to a dominant force in how people form relationships. This shift has had profound effects, not only on individuals looking for love but also on society as a whole, altering social norms, relationship dynamics, and even the concept of commitment itself.

One of the most widely discussed impacts is the perception of a "paradox of choice." Dating apps provide users with a seemingly endless stream of potential partners, far more than one could ever meet through traditional means. While this abundance of options might seem like an advantage, studies in behavioural psychology suggest it can have a negative effect. When faced with too many choices, people can experience decision paralysis, making it difficult to choose any single option. Furthermore, the constant awareness that a potentially "better" match might be just a swipe away can lead to a lack of satisfaction with current choices and a reluctance to commit to a relationship. This can foster a culture of "disposable dating," where connections are easily made and just as easily discarded.

Another significant social change is the way online dating has affected social circles and community integration. Historically, people were most likely to partner with someone from their immediate social environment—their neighbourhood, workplace, or circle of friends. Online dating has broken down these geographical and social barriers. A 2019 study from Stanford University found that meeting online has become the most popular way for couples in the United States to connect, surpassing introductions through friends. This has led to a notable increase in couples from different social backgrounds and levels of education, suggesting that online dating may be contributing to a more integrated and diverse society.

However, the widespread use of dating apps has also raised concerns about their impact on mental health. The process of being constantly evaluated based on a few photos and a short bio can be stressful and damaging to one's self-esteem. Users may experience feelings of rejection or anxiety if they do not receive as many matches or messages as they expect. The phenomenon of "ghosting"—where a person abruptly cuts off all communication without explanation—has become commonplace and can be a particularly painful form of social rejection. The pressure to present a perfect, highly curated version of oneself can also lead to feelings of inauthenticity and burnout.

Ultimately, the social legacy of the swipe-right world is complex and multifaceted. While online dating has created unprecedented opportunities for connection and has potentially contributed to a more diverse society, it has also introduced new challenges. It has altered our perception of choice, reshaped our social networks, and created new pressures on our mental well-being. As this technology continues to evolve, its long-term impact on the fabric of our social lives remains a critical area of observation and study.
