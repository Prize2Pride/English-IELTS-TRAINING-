### **Band 6 Model Answers & Useful Language**

#### **Part 2 Model Answer**

"Okay, so I’d like to talk about the first time I met my friend, Alex. It was about three years ago. At the time, I had just moved to a new city for my job, and I didn’t know anyone. I decided to join a local photography club to meet people with similar interests.

We met at the first meeting of the club, which was held in a small community centre. I was feeling quite nervous because I was new, but he was very friendly and came over to introduce himself. He was the organiser of the club.

We started talking about photography, of course. I remember he asked me what kind of camera I had and what subjects I enjoyed shooting. I told him I was interested in street photography, and he mentioned a few great spots in the city that I should check out. We also talked about our favourite photographers and discovered we had a lot in common.

My first impression of him was that he was very warm and welcoming. He was clearly passionate about photography, but he wasn’t arrogant about it at all. He seemed very genuine and easy to talk to, which immediately made me feel more comfortable and less like an outsider. I thought he was someone I could easily become friends with, and I was right. We’ve been good friends ever since that day."

#### **Useful Expressions & Fillers (for fluency)**

*   "Okay, so I’d like to talk about..."
*   "Let me see..."
*   "I remember..."
*   "If I recall correctly..."
*   "My first impression was that..."
*   "What I mean is..."

#### **Fluency Strategy: How to Extend Answers**

*   **Give a reason:** "I prefer talking on the phone **because** you can hear the person’s tone of voice."
*   **Give an example:** "It can be hard to make friends as an adult. **For example,** when you are busy with work, you have less free time."
*   **Explain your feelings:** "I was feeling quite nervous at first, **but then I felt** more relaxed after we started talking."
*   **Use contrasting ideas:** "**While** online apps are convenient, **I think** meeting in person is better for forming a real connection."

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid (for a Band 5.5–6.0+ score)**

*   **Don’t just describe, give your opinion.** In Part 3, the examiner wants to know what you think.
*   **Don’t be afraid to disagree with the premise of a question.** You can say, "Actually, I don’t think that’s true..."
*   **Avoid simple vocabulary.** Instead of "happy," try "delighted" or "pleased." Instead of "good," try "fantastic" or "wonderful."
*   **Make sure you answer the question that was asked.** Listen carefully and don’t go too far off-topic.
