# Listening Section: Online Dating

## Listening Task 1

**You will hear a man, David, giving a short presentation on how to stay safe when dating online. Listen and answer questions 1–6.**

### Audio Script: Staying Safe in the Digital Dating World

**(Audio instructions: The speaker should be a man with a standard British accent, speaking at a clear, moderate pace. His tone should be informative and reassuring, like a friendly expert giving advice.)**

**David:** Hello everyone. My name is David, and today I’m going to talk about something that’s become incredibly common: online dating. While these apps can be a fantastic way to meet new people, it’s also really important to be aware of how to stay safe. So, I’m going to share a few practical tips that everyone should keep in mind.

First and foremost, protect your personal information. When you’re chatting with someone new, don’t be in a hurry to give out private details like your home address, your place of work, or your phone number. Keep the conversation on the app’s messaging system for a while. Most platforms have safety features built in, and it’s wise to use them.

My second tip is about profile pictures. It’s a good idea to do a quick reverse image search on the photos of the person you’re talking to. It’s very easy to do—you can use a search engine. This can help you verify if the photos are genuine or if they have been taken from someone else’s profile. It’s a simple check that can prevent you from being ‘catfished’—which is when someone pretends to be a person they are not.

When you decide it’s time to meet in person, always choose a public place for your first date. A coffee shop, a restaurant, or a park are all good options. Never agree to meet at their home or have them pick you up from yours. It’s also a very good idea to let a friend or family member know your plans. Just send them a quick text with the details: who you’re meeting, where you’re going, and what time you expect to be back. This is a crucial safety net.

Finally, trust your intuition. If a conversation feels strange, or if someone is pressuring you to meet before you’re ready, it’s okay to slow down or end the conversation. If someone’s profile seems too good to be true, or if they avoid answering simple questions about their life, you should be cautious. Your gut feeling is a powerful tool, so don’t ignore it.

Online dating should be a fun and exciting experience. By taking these simple precautions, you can protect yourself and focus on making a genuine connection. Thank you for listening.

## Listening Task 2

**You will hear two colleagues, Fiona and Ben, talking about their different experiences with work-life balance. Listen and answer questions 7–12.**

### Audio Script: The Balancing Act

**(Audio instructions: This should be a conversation between a woman (Fiona) and a man (Ben). Both should have standard British accents and speak at a natural, conversational pace. Fiona’s tone should be slightly stressed and busy, while Ben’s should be more relaxed and content.)**

**Fiona:** Ben, have you got a minute? I’m really struggling with this report. I feel like I’ve been at my desk forever.

**Ben:** Of course. You do look a bit stressed. Is it the deadline?

**Fiona:** It’s everything! The deadline, the constant emails… I feel like I’m working all the time. I check my emails as soon as I wake up, and I’m still thinking about work when I go to bed. My work-life balance is a complete disaster at the moment.

**Ben:** I used to be like that. I was suffering from serious burnout about a year ago. I was working late every night, I wasn’t sleeping properly, and I had no energy for anything else. It really took a toll on my health.

**Fiona:** So what changed? You seem so much more relaxed now.

**Ben:** I had to make a conscious decision to set some boundaries. My biggest change was creating a ‘no-work’ zone in the evenings. At 6:30 pm, I turn off my work computer and I put my work phone in a drawer. It was hard at first, but it made a huge difference. It forces me to disconnect and focus on my personal life.

**Fiona:** I don’t think I could do that. I’d be too worried about missing something important.

**Ben:** That’s what I thought too. But then I realised that most things can wait until the morning. I also started scheduling my leisure time, just like I would a meeting. So, on Tuesdays, I go to a yoga class, and on Thursdays, I meet friends for dinner. Having those things in my diary gives me something to look forward to and forces me to leave the office on time.

**Fiona:** That’s a good idea. I just let my evenings get filled with more work. I’ve been meaning to join a gym for months, but I keep putting it off.

**Ben:** You should definitely do it! It’s not about having less ambition at work; it’s about making sure you have the energy to perform well when you *are* working. A good work-life balance makes you more productive, not less. For me, it was about realising that my well-being is just as important as any deadline.

**Fiona:** You’ve given me a lot to think about. A ‘no-work’ zone… it sounds revolutionary. Maybe I’ll start with just one evening a week and see how it goes.
